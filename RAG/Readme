Running the Code

This project includes two files:

A Jupyter Notebook that shows the development process and the final code.
A Python script that you can run using Streamlit for a more interactive experience.
API Keys

To run the code, you will need API keys from LLAMACLoud and GROQ. You can obtain these keys from the following links:

https://cloud.llamaindex.ai
https://console.groq.com/keys
Store these keys in a .env file in the project directory or initialize them in the scripts.



In the py script it doesnt use the same Parser since it will take time to parse and load the docummnt and then run the streamlit code so i commented it and used PyPDFLoader. You can uncomment it or use the note book to see the diffence.
