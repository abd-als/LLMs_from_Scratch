The 2024 Index is our most comprehensive to date and arrives at an important moment when AI’s influence on society has never been more pronounced. This year, we have broadened our scope to more extensively cover essential trends such as technical advancements in AI, public perceptions of the technology, and the geopolitical dynamics surrounding its development. Featuring more original data than ever before, this edition introduces new estimates on AI training costs, detailed analyses of the responsible AI landscape, and an entirely new chapter dedicated to AI’s impact on science and medicine.\\n\\nThe AI Index report tracks, collates, distills, and visualizes data related to artificial intelligence (AI). Our mission is to provide unbiased, rigorously vetted, broadly sourced data in order for policymakers, researchers, executives, journalists, and the general public to develop a more thorough and nuanced understanding of the complex field of AI.\\n\\nThe AI Index is recognized globally as one of the most credible and authoritative sources for data and insights on artificial intelligence. Previous editions have been cited in major newspapers, including The New York Times, Bloomberg, and The Guardian, have amassed hundreds of academic citations, and been referenced by high-level policymakers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, among other places. This year’s edition surpasses all previous ones in size, scale, and scope, reflecting the growing significance that AI is coming to hold in all of our lives.\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024\\n\\nMessage From the Co-directors\\n\\nA decade ago, the best AI systems in the world were unable to classify objects in images at a human level. AI struggled with language comprehension and could not solve math problems. Today, AI systems routinely exceed human performance on standard benchmarks.\\n\\nProgress accelerated in 2023. New state-of-the-art systems like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude 3 are impressively multimodal: They can generate fluent text in dozens of languages, process audio, and even explain memes. As AI has improved, it has increasingly forced its way into our lives. Companies are racing to build AI-based products, and AI is increasingly being used by the general public. But current AI technology still has significant problems. It cannot reliably deal with facts, perform complex reasoning, or explain its conclusions.\\n\\nAI faces two interrelated futures. First, technology continues to improve and is increasingly used, having major consequences for productivity and employment. It can be put to both good and bad uses. In the second future, the adoption of AI is constrained by the limitations of the technology. Regardless of which future unfolds, governments are increasingly concerned. They are stepping in to encourage the upside, such as funding university R&D and incentivizing private investment. Governments are also aiming to manage the potential downsides, such as impacts on employment, privacy concerns, misinformation, and intellectual property rights.\\n\\nAs AI rapidly evolves, the AI Index aims to help the AI community, policymakers, business leaders, journalists, and the general public navigate this complex landscape. It provides ongoing, objective snapshots tracking several key areas: technical progress in AI capabilities, the community and investments driving AI development and deployment, public opinion on current and potential future impacts, and policy measures taken to stimulate AI innovation while managing its risks and challenges. By comprehensively monitoring the AI ecosystem, the Index serves as an important resource for understanding this transformative technological force.\\n\\nOn the technical front, this year’s AI Index reports that the number of new large language models released worldwide in 2023 doubled over the previous year. Two-thirds were open-source, but the highest-performing models came from industry players with closed systems. Gemini Ultra became the first LLM to reach human-level performance on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark; performance on the benchmark has improved by 15 percentage points since last year. Additionally, GPT-4 achieved an impressive 0.96 mean win rate score on the comprehensive Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) benchmark, which includes MMLU among other evaluations.\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024\\n\\nMessage From the Co-directors (cont’d)\\n\\nAlthough global private investment in AI decreased for the second consecutive year, investment in generative AI skyrocketed. More Fortune 500 earnings calls mentioned AI than ever before, and new studies show that AI tangibly boosts worker productivity. On the policymaking front, global mentions of AI in legislative proceedings have never been higher. U.S. regulators passed more AI-related regulations in 2023 than ever before. Still, many expressed concerns about AI’s ability to generate deepfakes and impact elections. The public became more aware of AI, and studies suggest that they responded with nervousness.\\n\\nRay Perrault and Jack Clark\\n\\nCo-directors, AI Index\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Top 10 Takeaways\\n\\n1. AI beats humans on some tasks, but not on all. AI has surpassed human performance on several benchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding. Yet it trails behind on more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning, and planning.\\n\\n2. Industry continues to dominate frontier AI research. In 2023, industry produced 51 notable machine learning models, while academia contributed only 15. There were also 21 notable models resulting from industry-academia collaborations in 2023, a new high.\\n\\n3. Frontier models get way more expensive. According to AI Index estimates, the training costs of state-of-the-art AI models have reached unprecedented levels. For example, OpenAI’s GPT-4 used an estimated $78 million worth of compute to train, while Google’s Gemini Ultra cost $191 million for compute.\\n\\n4. The United States leads China, the EU, and the U.K. as the leading source of top AI models. In 2023, 61 notable AI models originated from U.S.-based institutions, far outpacing the European Union’s 21 and China’s 15.\\n\\n5. Robust and standardized evaluations for LLM responsibility are seriously lacking. New research from the AI Index reveals a significant lack of standardization in responsible AI reporting. Leading developers, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, primarily test their models against different responsible AI benchmarks. This practice complicates efforts to systematically compare the risks and limitations of top AI models.\\n\\n6. Generative AI investment skyrockets. Despite a decline in overall AI private investment last year, funding for generative AI surged, nearly octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion. Major players in the generative AI space, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Inflection, reported substantial fundraising rounds.\\n\\n7. The data is in: AI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work. In 2023, several studies assessed AI’s impact on labor, suggesting that AI enables workers to complete tasks more quickly and to improve the quality of their output. These studies also demonstrated AI’s potential to bridge the skill gap between low- and high-skilled workers. Still, other studies caution that using AI without proper oversight can lead to diminished performance.\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024\\n\\n8. Scientific progress accelerates even furper, panks to AI. In 2022, AI began to advance scientific discovery. 2023, however, saw pe launch of even more significant science-related AI applications— from AlphaDev, which makes algoripmic sorting more efficient, to GNoME, which facilitates pe process of materials discovery.\\n\\n9. The number of AI regulations in pe United States sharply increases. The number of AI-related regulations in pe U.S. has risen significantly in pe past year and over pe last five years. In 2023, pere were 25 AI-related regulations, up from just one in 2016. Last year alone, pe total number of AI-related regulations grew by 56.3%.\\n\\n10. People across pe globe are more cognizant of AI’s potential impact—and more nervous. A survey from Ipsos shows pat, over pe last year, pe proportion of pose who pink AI will dramatically affect peir lives in pe next pree to five years has increased from 60% to 66%. Moreover, 52% express nervousness toward AI products and services, marking a 13 percentage point rise from 2022. In America, Pew data suggests pat 52% of Americans report feeling more concerned pan excited about AI, rising from 37% in 2022.\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Steering Committee\\n\\n### Co-directors\\n\\nJack Clark, Anthropic, OECD\\nRaymond Perrault, SRI International\\n\\n### Members\\n\\n|Erik Brynjolfsson, Stanford University|Juan Carlos Niebles, Stanford University, Salesforce|\\n|---|---|\\n|John Etchemendy, Stanford University|Vanessa Parli, Stanford University|\\n|Katrina Ligett, Hebrew University|Yoav Shoham, Stanford University, AI21 Labs|\\n|Terah Lyons, JPMorgan Chase & Co.|Russell Wald, Stanford University|\\n|James Manyika, Google, University of Oxford| |\\n\\n### Staff and Researchers\\n\\nResearch Manager and Editor in Chief\\n\\nNestor Maslej\\nStanford University\\n\\nResearch Associate\\n\\nLoredana Fattorini\\nStanford University\\n\\nAffiliated Researchers\\n\\n|Elif Kiesow Cortez, Stanford Law School Research Fellow|Alexandra Rome, Freelance Researcher|\\n|---|---|\\n|Anka Reuel, Stanford University|Lapo Santarlasci, IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca|\\n|Robi Rahman, Data Scientist| |\\n\\nGraduate Researchers\\n\\n|James da Costa, Stanford University| |\\n|---|---|\\n|Simba Jonga, Stanford University| |\\n\\nUndergraduate Researchers\\n\\n|Emily Capstick, Stanford University|Julia Betts Lotufo, Stanford University|\\n|---|---|\\n|Summer Flowers, Stanford University|Sukrut Oak, Stanford University|\\n|Armin Hamrah, Claremont McKenna College|Andrew Shi, Stanford University|\\n|Amelia Hardy, Stanford University|Jason Shin, Stanford University|\\n|Mena Hassan, Stanford University|Emma Williamson, Stanford University|\\n|Ethan Duncan He-Li Hellman, Stanford University|Alfred Yu, Stanford University|\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024\\n\\nHow to Cite This Report\\n\\nNestor Maslej, Loredana Fattorini, Raymond Perrault, Vanessa Parli, Anka Reuel, Erik Brynjolfsson, John Etchemendy, Katrina Ligett, Terah Lyons, James Manyika, Juan Carlos Niebles, Yoav Shoham, Russell Wald, and Jack Clark, “The AI Index 2024 Annual Report,” AI Index Steering Committee, Institute for Human-Centered AI, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, April 2024.\\n\\nThe AI Index 2024 Annual Report by Stanford University is licensed under Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International.\\n\\nPublic Data and Tools\\n\\nThe AI Index 2024 Report is supplemented by raw data and an interactive tool.

The increase over the last year was a modest 1.1%.\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024\\n\\n### Report Highlights\\n\\nChapter 2: Technical Performance\\n1. AI beats humans on some tasks, but not on all. AI has surpassed human performance on several benchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding. Yet it trails behind on more complex tasks like competition-level mapematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning.\\n2. Here comes multimodal AI. Traditionally AI systems have been limited in scope, wip language models excelling in text comprehension but faltering in image processing, and vice versa. However, recent advancements have led to pe development of strong multimodal models, such as Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4. These models demonstrate flexibility and are capable of handling images and text and, in some instances, can even process audio.\\n3. Harder benchmarks emerge. AI models have reached performance saturation on established benchmarks such as ImageNet, SQuAD, and SuperGLUE, prompting researchers to develop more challenging ones. In 2023, several challenging new benchmarks emerged, including SWE-bench for coding, HEIM for image generation, MMMU for general reasoning, MoCa for moral reasoning, AgentBench for agent-based behavior, and HaluEval for hallucinations.\\n4. Better AI means better data which means … even better AI. New AI models such as SegmentAnyping and Skoltech are being used to generate specialized data for tasks like image segmentation and 3D reconstruction. Data is vital for AI technical improvements. The use of AI to create more data enhances current capabilities and paves pe way for future algoripmic improvements, especially on harder tasks.\\n5. Human evaluation is in. Wip generative models producing high-quality text, images, and more, benchmarking has slowly started shifting toward incorporating human evaluations like pe Chatbot Arena Leaderboard raper pan computerized rankings like ImageNet or SQuAD. Public sentiment about AI is becoming an increasingly important consideration in tracking AI progress.\\n6. Thanks to LLMs, robots have become more flexible. The fusion of language modeling wip robotics has given rise to more flexible robotic systems like PaLM-E and RT-2. Beyond peir improved robotic capabilities, pese models can ask questions, which marks a significant step toward robots pat can interact more effectively wip pe real world.\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024\\n\\nChapter 2: Technical Performance (cont’d)\\n\\n7. More technical research in agentic AI. Creating AI agents, systems capable of autonomous operation in specific environments, has long challenged computer scientists.

This year, researchers found less obvious strategies to get LLMs to exhibit harmful behavior, like asking pe models to infinitely repeat random words.\\n4. Risks from AI are becoming a concern for businesses across pe globe. A global survey on responsible AI highlights pat companies’ top AI-related concerns include privacy, data security, and reliability. The survey shows pat organizations are beginning to take steps to mitigate pese risks. Globally, however, most companies have so far only mitigated a small portion of pese risks.\\n5. LLMs can output copyrighted material. Multiple researchers have shown pat pe generative outputs of popular LLMs may contain copyrighted material, such as excerpts from The New York Times or scenes from movies. Wheper such output constitutes copyright violations is becoming a central legal question.\\n6. AI developers score low on transparency, wip consequences for research. The newly introduced Foundation Model Transparency Index shows pat AI developers lack transparency, especially regarding pe disclosure of training data and mepodologies. This lack of openness hinders efforts to furper understand pe robustness and safety of AI systems.\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024\\n\\n### Chapter 3: Responsible AI (cont’d)\\n\\n7. Extreme AI risks are difficult to analyze. Over the past year, a substantial debate has emerged among AI scholars and practitioners regarding the focus on immediate model risks, like algorithmic discrimination, versus potential long-term existential threats. It has become challenging to distinguish which claims are scientifically founded and should inform policymaking. This difficulty is compounded by the tangible nature of already present short-term risks in contrast with the theoretical nature of existential threats.\\n\\n8. The number of AI incidents continues to rise. According to the AI Incident Database, which tracks incidents related to the misuse of AI, 123 incidents were reported in 2023, a 32.3 percentage point increase from 2022. Since 2013, AI incidents have grown by over twentyfold. A notable example includes AI-generated, sexually explicit deepfakes of Taylor Swift that were widely shared online.\\n\\n9.

While many new AI models are introduced annually, only a small sample represents the most advanced research. Admittedly what constitutes advanced or frontier research is somewhat subjective. Frontier research could reflect a model posting a new state-of-the-art result on a benchmark, introducing a meaningful new architecture, or exercising some impressive new capabilities.\\n\\nThe AI Index studies trends in two types of frontier AI models: “notable models” and foundation models. Epoch, an AI Index data provider, uses the term “notable machine learning models” to designate noteworthy models handpicked as being particularly influential within the AI/machine learning ecosystem. In contrast, foundation models are exceptionally large AI models trained on massive datasets, capable of performing a multitude of downstream tasks. Examples of foundation models include GPT-4, Claude 3, and Gemini. While many foundation models may qualify as notable models, not all notable models are foundation models.\\n\\nWithin this section, the AI Index explores trends in notable models and foundation models from various perspectives, including originating organization, country of origin, parameter count, and compute usage. The analysis concludes with an examination of machine learning training costs.\\n\\n### General Machine Learning Models Overview\\n\\nEpoch AI is a group of researchers dedicated to studying and predicting the evolution of advanced AI. They maintain a database of AI and machine learning models released since the 1950s, selecting entries based on criteria such as state-of-the-art advancements, historical significance, or high citation rates. Analyzing these models provides a comprehensive overview of the machine learning landscape’s evolution, both in recent years and over the past few decades. Some models may be missing from the dataset; however, the dataset can reveal trends in relative terms.\\n\\n“AI system” refers to a computer program or product based on AI, such as ChatGPT. “AI model” refers to a collection of parameters whose values are learned during training, such as GPT-4. New and historic models are continually added to the Epoch database, so the total year-by-year counts of models included in this year’s AI Index might not exactly match those published in last year’s report.\\n---\\n## Number of notable machine learning models\\n\\nArtificial IntelligenceArtificial Intelligence\\n\\nChapter 1: Research and Development\\n\\n2003 Index Report 2024Index Report 2024 1.3 Frontier AI Research\\n\\n2004\\n\\n2005\\n\\n2006 Sector Analysis\\n\\n2007\\n\\n2008 Until 2014, academia led in the release of machine learning models.

Significantly, 21 notable models resulted from industry/academic collaborations in 2023, a new high.

Generally, the complexity of the model and the size of the training dataset directly influence the amount of compute needed. The more complex a model is, and the larger the underlying training data, the greater the amount of compute required for training.\\n\\nFigure 1.3.6 visualizes the training compute required for notable machine learning models in the last 20 years. Recently, the compute usage of notable AI models has increased exponentially. This trend has been especially pronounced in the last five years. This rapid rise in compute demand has critical implications. For instance, models requiring more computation often have larger environmental footprints, and companies typically have more access to computational resources than academic institutions.\\n\\nTraining compute of notable machine learning models by sector, 2003–23\\n\\nSource: Epoch, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n| |Academia|Industry|Industry-academia|Academia-government|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|10B|Industry–research collective|Government|Research collective| |\\n|100M| | | | |\\n|1M| | | | |\\n|10K| | | | |\\n|100| | | | |\\n| | | | |1|\\n|0.01| | | | |\\n|2003|2004|2005|2006|2007|2008|2009|2010|2011|2012|2013|2014|2015|2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|\\n\\n6 FLOP stands for “floating-point operation.” A floating-point operation is a single arithmetic operation involving floating-point numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The number of FLOPs a processor or computer can perform per second is an indicator of its computational power. The higher the FLOP rate, the more powerful the computer is. An AI model with a higher FLOP rate reflects its requirement for more computational resources during training.\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\nChapter 1 Preview\\n\\n50\\n---\\n## Training compute (petaFLOP - log scale)\\n\\n|Artificial Intelligence|Artificial Intelligence|Chapter 1: Research and Development|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Index Report 2024|Index Report 2024|1.3 Frontier AI Research|\\n\\nFigure 1.3.7 highlights the training compute of notable machine learning models since 2012.

As noted recently by Anthropic cofounder and AI Index Steering Committee member Jack Clark, foundation models have been trained on meaningful percentages of all the data that has ever existed on the internet.\\n\\nThe growing data dependency of AI models has led to concerns that future generations of computer scientists will run out of data to further scale and improve their systems. Research from Epoch suggests that these concerns are somewhat warranted. Epoch researchers have generated historical and compute-based projections for when AI researchers might expect to run out of data. The historical projections are based on observed growth rates in the sizes of data used to train foundation models. The compute projections adjust the historical growth rate based on projections of compute availability.\\n\\n|Stock type|Historical projection|Compute projection|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Low-quality language stock|2032.4 [2028.4; 2039.2]|2040.5 [2034.6; 2048.9]|\\n|High-quality language stock|2024.5 [2023.5; 2025.7]|2024.1 [2023.2; 2025.3]|\\n|Image stock|2046 [2037; 2062.8]|2038.8 [2032; 2049.8]|\\n\\nFigure 1.3.8\\n\\nFor instance, the researchers estimate that computer scientists could deplete the stock of high-quality language data by 2024, exhaust low-quality language data within two decades, and use up image data by the late 2030s to mid-2040s (Figure 1.3.8).\\n\\nTheoretically, the challenge of limited data availability can be addressed by using synthetic data, which is data generated by AI models themselves. For example, it is possible to use text produced by one LLM to train another LLM. The use of synthetic data for training AI systems is particularly attractive, not only as a solution for potential data depletion but also because generative AI systems could, in principle, generate data in instances where naturally occurring data is sparse—for example, data for rare diseases or underrepresented populations. Until recently, the feasibility and effectiveness of using synthetic data for training generative AI systems were not well understood. However, research this year has suggested that there are limitations associated with training models on synthetic data.\\n\\nFor instance, a team of British and Canadian researchers discovered that models predominantly trained on synthetic data experience model collapse, a phenomenon where, over time, they lose the ability to remember true underlying data distributions and start producing a narrow range of\\n\\nTable of Contents Chapter 1 Preview 52\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 1: Research and Development\\n\\nIndex Report 2024\\n\\n1.3 Frontier AI Research\\n\\nHighlight:\\n\\nWill Models Run Out of Data?

With each subsequent generation trained on additional synthetic data, the model produces an increasingly limited set of outputs. As illustrated in Figure 1.3.10, in statistical terms, as the number of synthetic generations increases, the tails of the distributions vanish, and the generation density shifts toward the mean. This pattern means that This pattern means that 7 In the context of generative models, density refers to the level of complexity and variation in the outputs produced by an AI model.

The authors label this phenomenon Model Autophagy Disorder (MAD), in reference to mad cow disease. The study examines two types of training processes: fully synthetic, where models are trained exclusively on synthetic data, and synthetic augmentation, where models are trained on a mix of synthetic and real data. In both scenarios, as the number of training generations increases, the quality of the generated images declines. Figure 1.3.11 highlights the degraded image generations of models that are augmented with synthetic data; for example, the faces generated in steps 7 and 9 increasingly display strange-looking hash marks. From a statistical perspective, images generated with both synthetic data and synthetic augmentation loops have higher FID scores (indicating less similarity to real images), lower precision scores (signifying reduced realism or quality), and lower recall scores (suggesting decreased diversity) (Figure 1.3.12). While synthetic augmentation loops, which incorporate some real data, show less degradation than fully synthetic loops, both methods exhibit diminishing returns with further training.\\n\\nTable of Contents Chapter 1 Preview 54\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024\\n\\n### Chapter 1: Research and Development\\n\\nHighlight: Will Models Run Out of Data?

Figures 1.3.18, 1.3.19, and 1.3.20 visualize the national affiliations of various foundation models. As with the notable model analysis presented earlier in the chapter, a model is deemed affiliated with a country if a researcher contributing to that model is affiliated with an institution headquartered in that country.\\n\\n|Number of foundation models|2023|\\n|---|---|\\n|United States|109|\\n|China|20|\\n|United Kingdom|8|\\n|United Arab Emirates|4|\\n|Canada|3|\\n|Singapore|2|\\n|Israel|2|\\n|Germany|2|\\n|Finland|2|\\n|Taiwan|1|\\n|Switzerland|1|\\n|Sweden|1|\\n|Spain|1|\\n|France|1|\\n\\nIn 2023, most of the world’s foundation models originated from the United States (109), followed by China (20), and the United Kingdom (Figure 1.3.18).

While AI companies seldom reveal the expenses involved in training their models, it is widely believed that these costs run into millions of dollars and are rising. For instance, OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, mentioned that the training cost for GPT-4 was over $100 million. This escalation in training expenses has effectively excluded universities, traditionally centers of AI research, from developing their own leading-edge foundation models. In response, policy initiatives, such as President Biden’s Executive Order on AI, have sought to level the playing field between industry and academia by creating a National AI Research Resource, which would grant nonindustry actors the compute and data needed to do higher level AI-research.\\n\\nUnderstanding the cost of training AI models is important, yet detailed information on these costs remains scarce. The AI Index was among the first to offer estimates on the training costs of foundation models in last year’s publication. This year, the AI Index has collaborated with Epoch AI, an AI research institute, to substantially enhance and solidify the robustness of its AI training cost estimates. To estimate the cost of cutting-edge models, the Epoch team analyzed training duration, as well as the type, quantity, and utilization rate of the training hardware, using information from publications, press releases, or technical reports related to the models.\\n\\nFigure 1.3.21 visualizes the estimated training cost associated with select AI models, based on cloud compute rental prices. AI Index estimates validate suspicions that in recent years model training costs have significantly increased. For example, in 2017, the original Transformer model, which introduced the architecture that underpins virtually every modern LLM, cost around $900 to train. RoBERTa Large, released in 2019, which achieved state-of-the-art results on many canonical comprehension benchmarks like SQuAD and GLUE, cost around $160,000 to train. Fast-forward to 2023, and training costs for OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini Ultra are estimated to be around $78 million and $191 million, respectively.\\n\\nBen Cottier and Robi Rahman led research at Epoch AI into model training cost.\\n\\nA detailed description of the estimation methodology is provided in the Appendix.\\n\\nThe cost figures reported in this section are inflation-adjusted.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nChapter 1 Preview\\n\\n63\\n---\\n## Training cost (in U.S. dollars)Training cost (in U.S. dollars - log scale)\\n\\n|Artificial Intelligence|Artificial Intelligence|\\n|---|---|\\n|Chapter 1: Research and Development|Index Report 2024|\\n| |1.3 Frontier AI Research|\\n\\n## Estimated training cost of select AI models, 2017–23\\n\\n|Model|Estimated Cost|\\n|---|---|\\n|BERT-Large|200M|\\n|RoBERTa Large|150M|\\n| |100M|\\n|GPT-3 175B (davinci)|50M|\\n|Megatron-Turing NLG 530B|0|\\n| |930|\\n| |3,288|\\n| |160,018|\\n| |4,324,883|\\n| |6,405,653|\\n| |1,319,586|\\n| |12,389,056|\\n| |3,931,897|\\n\\n## LaMDA\\n\\n2017\\n2018\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n2023\\n\\n## Estimated training cost of select AI models, 2016–23\\n\\n|Model|Estimated Cost|\\n|---|---|\\n|Llama 2 70B|Source: Epoch, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report|\\n|Gemini Ultra|100M|\\n| |10M|\\n| |1M|\\n| |100K|\\n| |10K|\\n| |1000|\\n| |100|\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\nChapter 1 Preview\\n\\n64\\n---\\n## Chapter 1: Research and Development\\n\\nAs established in previous AI Index reports, there is a direct correlation between the training costs of AI models and their computational requirements.

This edition of the AI Index is the first to adopt this updated approach. Moreover, the previous edition of the AI Index utilized country-level mapping of GitHub AI projects conducted by the OECD, which depended on self-reported data—a method experiencing a decline in coverage over time. This year, the AI Index has adopted geographic mapping from GitHub, leveraging server-side data for broader coverage.

Among the most starred repositories are libraries such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, Keras, and PyTorch, which enjoy widespread popularity among software developers in the AI coding community. For example, TensorFlow is a popular library for building and deploying machine learning models. OpenCV is a platform that offers a variety of tools for computer vision, such as object detection and feature extraction. The total number of stars for AI-related projects on GitHub saw a significant increase in the last year, more than tripling from 4.0 million in 2022 to 12.2 million in 2023 (Figure 1.5.3).

It starts with a high-level overview of AI technical performance, tracing its broad evolution over time. The chapter then examines the current state of a wide range of AI capabilities, including language processing, coding, computer vision (image and video analysis), reasoning, audio processing, autonomous agents, robotics, and reinforcement learning. It also shines a spotlight on notable AI research breakthroughs from the past year, exploring methods for improving LLMs through prompting, optimization, and fine-tuning, and wraps up with an exploration of AI systems’ environmental footprint.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n76\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## Chapter Highlights\\n\\n1. AI beats humans on some tasks, but not on all. AI has surpassed human performance on several benchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding. Yet it trails behind on more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning.\\n\\n2. Here comes multimodal AI. Traditionally AI systems have been limited in scope, with language models excelling in text comprehension but faltering in image processing, and vice versa. However, recent advancements have led to the development of strong multimodal models, such as Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4. These models demonstrate flexibility and are capable of handling images and text and, in some instances, can even process audio.\\n\\n3. Harder benchmarks emerge. AI models have reached performance saturation on established benchmarks such as ImageNet, SQuAD, and SuperGLUE, prompting researchers to develop more challenging ones. In 2023, several challenging new benchmarks emerged, including SWE-bench for coding, HEIM for image generation, MMMU for general reasoning, MoCa for moral reasoning, AgentBench for agent-based behavior, and HaluEval for hallucinations.\\n\\n4. Better AI means better data which means … even better AI. New AI models such as SegmentAnything and Skoltech are being used to generate specialized data for tasks like image segmentation and 3D reconstruction. Data is vital for AI technical improvements. The use of AI to create more data enhances current capabilities and paves the way for future algorithmic improvements, especially on harder tasks.\\n\\n5. Human evaluation is in. With generative models producing high-quality text, images, and more, benchmarking has slowly started shifting toward incorporating human evaluations like the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard rather than computerized rankings like ImageNet or SQuAD. Public feeling about AI is becoming an increasingly important consideration in tracking AI progress.\\n\\n6. Thanks to LLMs, robots have become more flexible. The fusion of language modeling with robotics has given rise to more flexible robotic systems like PaLM-E and RT-2. Beyond their improved robotic capabilities, these models can ask questions, which marks a significant step toward robots that can interact more effectively with the real world.\\n\\n7. More technical research in agentic AI. Creating AI agents, systems capable of autonomous operation in specific environments, has long challenged computer scientists. However, emerging research suggests that the performance of autonomous AI agents is improving. Current agents can now master complex games like Minecraft and effectively tackle real-world tasks, such as online shopping and research assistance.\\n\\n8. Closed LLMs significantly outperform open ones. On 10 select AI benchmarks, closed models outperformed open ones, with a median performance advantage of 24.2%. Differences in the performance of closed and open models carry important implications for AI policy debates.\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n---\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\nThe technical performance chapter begins with a high-level overview of significant model releases in 2023 and reviews the current state of AI technical performance.\\n\\n### 2.1 Overview of AI in 2023\\n\\nTimeline: Significant Model Releases\\n\\nAs chosen by the AI Index Steering Committee, here are some of the most notable model releases of 2023.\\n\\n|Date|Model|Type|Creator(s)|Significance|Image|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Mar. 14, 2023|Claude|Large language model|Anthropic|Claude is the first publicly released LLM from Anthropic, one of OpenAI’s main rivals.

For example, ImageNet is a canonical AI benchmark that features a large collection of labeled images, and AI systems are tasked with classifying these images accurately. Tracking progress on benchmarks has been a standard way for the AI community to monitor the advancement of AI systems.\\n\\n2 In Figure 2.1.16, the values are scaled to establish a standard metric for comparing different benchmarks. The scaling function is calibrated such that the performance of the best model for each year is measured as a percentage of the human baseline for a given task. A value of 105% indicates, for example, that a model performs 5% better than the human baseline.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nChapter 2 Preview\\n\\n81\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\nIndex Report 2024\\n\\n2.1 Overview of AI in 2023\\n\\nAI Index Benchmarks\\n\\nAn emerging theme in AI technical performance, as emphasized in last year’s report, is the observed saturation on many benchmarks, such as ImageNet, used to assess the proficiency of AI models. Performance on these benchmarks has stagnated in recent years, indicating either a plateau in AI capabilities or a shift among researchers toward more complex research challenges.\\n\\nA selection of deprecated benchmarks from the 2023 AI Index report\\n\\nSource: AI Index, 2024\\n\\n|Benchmark|Task category|Year introduced|Improvement from 2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Abductive Natural Language Inference (aNLI)|Natural language inference|2019|NA|\\n|arXiv|Text summarization|2003|NA|\\n|Cityscapes Challenge|Semantic segmentation|2016|0.23%|\\n|ImageNet|Image classification|2009|1.54%|\\n|Kinetics-400|Activity recognition|2017|NA|\\n|Kinetics-600|Activity recognition|2018|NA|\\n|Kinetics-700|Activity recognition|2019|NA|\\n|Kvasir-SEG|Medical image segmentation|2019|1.90%|\\n|MPII|Human pose estimation|2014|NA|\\n|PubMed|Text summarization|2008|NA|\\n|SST-5 Fine-Grained Classification|Sentiment analysis|2013|NA|\\n|STL-10|Image generation|2011|NA|\\n|SuperGLUE|English language understanding|2019|NA|\\n|Visual Question Answering Challenge (VQA)|Visual reasoning|2017|NA|\\n|VoxCeleb|Speech recognition|2017|NA|\\n\\nFigure 2.1.17\\n\\n3 Benchmarks can also saturate or see limited improvement because the problem created is hard and the corresponding performance fails to improve. The issue of benchmark saturation discussed in this section refers more to benchmarks where performance reaches a close-to-perfection level on which it is difficult to improve.\\n\\n4 For brevity, Figure 2.1.17 highlights a selection of deprecated benchmarks. Additional benchmarks that were deprecated either because there was saturation, no new state-of-the-art score was documented, or research focus shifted away from the benchmark include: Celeb-DF (deepfake detection), CIFAR-10 (image classification), NIST FRVT (facial recognition), and Procgen (reinforcement learning).\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nChapter 2 Preview\\n\\n82\\n---\\n## Year-over-year improvement (%)\\n\\n|Artificial Intelligence|Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024|\\n|---|---|\\n|Chapter 2: Technical Performance|2.1 Overview of AI in 2023|\\n\\nFigure 2.1.18 illustrates the year-over-year improvement, in percent, on a selection of benchmarks featured in the 2023 AI Index report.

The presence of real-world instances where LLMs have produced hallucinations—in court cases, for example—underscores the growing necessity of closely monitoring trends in LLM factuality.\\n\\nTruthfulQA\\n\\nIntroduced at ACL 2022, TruthfulQA is a benchmark designed to evaluate the truthfulness of LLMs in generating answers to questions. This benchmark comprises approximately 800 questions across 38 categories, including health, politics, and finance.\\n\\nFigure 2.2.9\\n\\nMany questions are crafted to challenge commonly held misconceptions, which typically lead humans to answer incorrectly (Figure 2.2.9). Although one of the observations of the paper is that larger models tend to be less truthful, GPT-4 (RLHF) released in early 2024, has achieved the highest performance thus far on the TruthfulQA benchmark, with a score of 0.6 (Figure 2.2.10). This score is nearly three times higher than that of a GPT-2-based model tested in 2021, indicating that LLMs are becoming progressively better at providing truthful answers.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nChapter 2 Preview\\n90\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## 2.2 Language\\n\\nMultiple-choice task on TruthfulQA: MC1\\n\\nSource: Papers with Code, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n| |0.60|\\n|---|---|\\n| |0.55|\\n| |0.50|\\n| |0.45|\\n| |0.40|\\n| |0.35|\\n| |0.30|\\n\\n2021 2022 2023\\n\\nFigure 2.2.10\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nChapter 2 Preview\\n91\\n---\\n## Artificial IntelligenceArtificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\nIndex Report 2024Index Report 2024 2.2 Language\\n\\nHaluEval A generated hallucinated QA example and a As previously mentioned, LLMs are prone to human-labeled ChatGPT response for a user query hallucinations, a concerning trait given their widespread deployment in critical fields such as law and medicine. While existing research has aimed to understand the causes of hallucinations, less effort has been directed toward assessing the frequency of LLM hallucinations and identifying specific content areas where they are especially vulnerable. HaluEval, introduced in 2023, is a new benchmark designed to assess hallucinations in LLMs. It includes over 35,000 samples, both hallucinated and normal, for analysis and evaluation by LLMs (Figure 2.2.11). The research indicates that ChatGPT fabricates unverifiable information in approximately 19.5% of its responses, with these fabrications spanning a variety of topics such as language, climate, and technology. Furthermore, the study examines how well current LLMs can detect hallucinations. Figure 2.2.12 illustrates the performance of leading LLMs in identifying hallucinations across various tasks, including question answering, knowledge-grounded dialogue, and text summarization. The findings reveal that many LLMs struggle with these tasks, highlighting that hallucination is a significant ongoing issue.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nChapter 2 Preview\\nTATA\\n92\\nImg\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## 2.2 Language\\n\\n|Models|QA|Dialogue|Summarization|General|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|ChatGPT (2022)|62.59%|72.40%|58.53%|79.44%|\\n|Claude 2(2023)|69.78%|64.73%|57.75%|75.00%|\\n|Claude (2023)|67.60%|64.83%|53.76%|73.88%|\\n|Davinci002(2022)|60.05%|60.81%|47.77%|80.42%|\\n|Davinci003(2022)|49.65%|68.37%|48.07%|80.40%|\\n|GPT-3 (2020)|49.21%|50.02%|51.23%|72.72%|\\n|Llama2 (2023)|49.60%|43.99%|49.55%|20.46%|\\n|ChatGLM (2023)|47.93%|44.41%|48.57%|30.92%|\\n|Falcon (2023)|39.66%|29.08%|42.71%|18.98%|\\n|Vicuna (2023)|60.34%|46.35%|45.62%|19.48%|\\n|Alpaca(2023)|6.68%|17.55%|20.63%|9.54%|\\n\\nFigure 2.2.12\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nChapter 2 Preview\\n\\n93\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\nCoding involves the generation of instructions that computers can follow to perform tasks.

Today’s image generators are so advanced that most people struggle to differentiate between AI-generated images and actual images of human faces (Figure 2.4.1). Figure 2.4.2 highlights several generations from various Midjourney model variants from 2022 to 2024 for the prompt “a hyper-realistic image of Harry Potter.” The progression demonstrates the significant improvement in Midjourney’s ability to generate hyper-realistic images over a two-year period. In 2022, the model produced cartoonish and inaccurate renderings of Harry Potter, but by 2024, it could create startlingly realistic depictions.\\n\\nMidjourney generations over time: “a hyper-realistic image of Harry Potter” Source: Midjourney, 2023\\n\\nCAP ACCREDITED COLLEGE of AMERICAN PATHOLOGISTS V1, FebruaryV2, April 2022 V3, July 2022 2022 V4, November 2022 V5, March 2023 V5.1, March 2023 V5.2, June 2023 V6, December 2023\\n\\nFigure 2.4.1\\n\\nTable of Contents Chapter 2 Preview 96\\n\\nFigure 2.4.2\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\nIndex Report 2024\\n\\n2.4 Image Computer Vision and Image Generation\\n\\n|Task|Leading model|Score|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Image-text-alignment|DALL-E 2 (3.5B)|0.94|\\n|Quality|Dreamlike Photoreal v2.0 (1B)|0.92|\\n|Aesthetics|Dreamlike Photoreal v2.0 (1B)|0.87|\\n|Originality|Dreamlike Photoreal v2.0 (1B)|0.98|\\n\\nHEIM: Holistic Evaluation of Text-to-Image Models\\n\\nThe rapid progress of AI text-to-image systems has prompted the development of more sophisticated evaluation methods. In 2023, Stanford researchers introduced the Holistic Evaluation of Text-to-Image Models (HEIM), a benchmark designed to comprehensively assess image generators across 12 key aspects crucial for real-world deployment, such as image-text alignment, image quality, and aesthetics. Human evaluators are used to rate the models, a crucial feature since many automated metrics struggle to accurately assess various aspects of images.\\n\\nHEIM’s findings indicate that no single model excels in all criteria. For human evaluation of image-to-text alignment (assessing how well the generated image matches the input text), OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 scores highest. In terms of image quality, aesthetics, and originality, the Stable Diffusion–based Dreamlike Photoreal model ranks highest.\\n\\nThe 12 evaluation aspects of HEIM are: (1) Alignment: How closely does the image align with the given text? (2) Quality: What is the quality of the produced image? (3) Aesthetic: How aesthetically pleasing is the generated image? (4) Originality: How original is the image? (5) Reasoning: Does the model understand objects, counts, and spatial relations? (6) Knowledge: Does the model have knowledge about the world? (7) Bias: Are the generated images biased? (8) Toxicity: Are the generated images toxic or inappropriate? (9) Fairness: Do the generated images exhibit performance disparities? (10) Robust: Is the model robust to input perturbations? (11) Multilinguality: Does the model support non-English languages? (12) Efficiency: How fast is model inference?\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nChapter 2 Preview\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\nHighlighted Research:\\n\\nMVDream\\n\\nCreating 3D geometries or models from text prompts has been a significant challenge for AI researchers, with existing models struggling with problems such as multiface Janus issue (inaccurately regenerating context described by text prompts) and content drift (inconsistency across different 3D views).

To address this limitation, an international team of researchers has applied latent diffusion models, traditionally used for generating high-quality images, to produce high-resolution videos. Their Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) notably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods released in 2022 like Long Video GAN (LVG) in resolution quality. The adaptation of a text-to-image architecture to create LDM, a highly effective text-to-video model, exemplifies how advanced AI techniques can be repurposed across different domains of computer vision. The LDM’s strong video generation capabilities have many real-world applications, such as creating realistic driving simulations.\\n\\nHigh-quality generation of milk dripping into a cup of coffee\\n\\nSource: Blattmann et al., 2023\\n\\nVideo LDM vs. LVG: FVD and FID\\n\\nSource: Blattmann et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n| |FVD ↓|FID ↓|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|500|478| |\\n|400| |389|356|\\n|300| | |\\n|200| | |\\n|100|53.50|51.90|\\n|0|LVG|Video LDM|Video LDM (cond.)|2022|2023|\\n\\nFigure 2.5.3\\n\\nTable of Contents              Chapter 2 Preview                                                                                                       110\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\nEmu Video win rate Index Report 2024\\n\\n2.5 Video Computer Vision and Video Generation\\n\\nHighlighted Research: Sample Emu Video generations\\n\\nMake-A-Video Emu Video Source: Girdhar et al., 2023\\n\\nTraditionally, progress in video generation has trailed that in image generation due to its higher complexity and the smaller datasets available for training.

AI systems are increasingly being tested in diverse reasoning contexts, including visual (reasoning about images), moral (understanding moral dilemmas), and social reasoning (navigating social situations).\\n\\n### General Reasoning\\n\\nGeneral reasoning pertains to AI systems being able to reason across broad, rather than specific, domains. As part of a general reasoning challenge, for example, an AI system might be asked to reason across multiple subjects rather than perform one narrow task (e.g., playing chess).\\n\\nMMMU: A Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark for Expert AGI\\n\\nIn recent years, the reasoning abilities of AI systems have advanced so much that traditional benchmarks like SQuAD (for textual reasoning) and VQA (for visual reasoning) have become saturated, indicating a need for more challenging reasoning tests.\\n\\nResponding to this, researchers from the United States and Canada recently developed MMMU, the Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark for Expert AGI.\\n\\nMMMU comprises about 11,500 college-level questions from six core disciplines: art and design, business, science, health and medicine, humanities and social science, and technology and engineering. The question formats include charts, maps, tables, chemical structures, and more. MMMU is one of the most demanding tests of perception, knowledge, and reasoning in AI to date. As of January 2024, the highest performing model is Gemini Ultra, which leads in all subject categories with an overall score of 59.4%.\\n\\nOn most individual task categories, top models are still well beyond medium-level human experts. This relatively low score is evidence of MMMU’s effectiveness as a benchmark for assessing AI reasoning capabilities.\\n\\nSome abilities highlighted in the previous sections implicitly involve some form of reasoning. This section highlights tasks that have a more specific reasoning focus.\\n\\nThe AI Index reports results from the MMMU validation set, as recommended by the paper authors for the most comprehensive coverage. According to the authors, the test set, with its unreleased labels and larger size, presents a more challenging yet unbiased benchmark for model performance, ensuring a more robust evaluation.

While recent LLMs like GPT-4 have shown impressive performance, their capability for true abstract reasoning remains a hotly debated subject. To further explore this topic, researchers from the Santa Fe Institute tested GPT-4 on the ConceptARC benchmark, a collection of analogy puzzles designed to assess general abstract reasoning skills (Figure 2.6.6). The study revealed that GPT-4 significantly trails behind humans in abstract reasoning abilities: While humans score 95% on the benchmark, the best GPT-4 system only scores 69% (Figure 2.6.7).

Therefore, it is essential for AI systems to possess robust moral reasoning capabilities, enabling them to effectively navigate and reason about ethical principles and moral considerations.\\n\\nMoCa\\n\\nThe ability of AI models to reason in linguistic and visual domains is well established, yet their capacity for moral reasoning, especially moral reasoning that aligns with human moral judgments, is less understood. To further explore this topic, a team of Stanford researchers created a new dataset (MoCa) of human stories with moral elements (Figure 2.6.15). The researchers then presented these models with stories of human actions and prompted the models to respond, measuring moral agreement with the discrete agreement metric: A higher score indicates closer alignment with human moral judgment. The study yielded intriguing results. No model perfectly matches human moral systems, but newer, larger models like GPT-4 and Claude show greater alignment with human moral sentiments than smaller models like GPT-3, suggesting that as AI models scale, they are gradually becoming more morally aligned with humans. Of all models surveyed, GPT-4 showed the greatest agreement with human moral sentiments (Figure 2.6.16).\\n\\n14 The topic of AI and moral alignment is contentious, as there are no universally agreed-upon moral principles. What constitutes moral alignment for one party may significantly differ for another.\\n\\n|Table of Contents|Chapter 2 Preview|\\n|---|---|\\n| |122|\\n---\\n|Discrete agreement (agg.)|Artificial Intelligence|Chapter 2: Technical Performance|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Index Report 2024|Index Report 2024|2.6 Reasoning|\\n|ALBERT-xxlarge| | |\\n|RoBERTa-large|Zero-shot alignment with human judgments on the moral permissibility task: discrete agreement|Source: Nie et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report|\\n|GPT-2-XL|40|37.10|\\n|GPT-3-babbage-v1|30|23.40|\\n| | |26.60|\\n| | |26.60|\\n| | |26.60|\\n| | |32.30|\\n| | |32.30|\\n|Electra-gen-large|20|18.50|\\n| | |20.20|\\n| | | |\\n|GPT-3-curie-v1|0| |\\n|GPT-3.5-davinci-v3| | |\\n|GPT-3.5-davinci-v2| |2019|\\n| | |2020|\\n| | |2022|\\n| | |2023|\\n|Alpaca-7B| |Figure 2.6.16|\\n|Anthropic-claude-v1| | |\\n|GPT-3.5-turbo| | |\\n|GPT-4| | |\\n\\nTable of Contents Chapter 2 Preview 123\\n---\\n## Artificial IntelligenceArtificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\n## Index Report 2024Index Report 2024\\n\\n## 2.6 Reasoning\\n\\nCausal Reasoning\\n\\nCausal reasoning assesses an AI system’s ability to understand cause-and-effect relationships. As AI becomes increasingly ubiquitous, it has become important to evaluate whether AI models can not only explain their outputs but also update their conclusions—key aspects of causal reasoning.\\n\\nBigToM\\n\\nAssessing whether LLMs have theory-of-mind (ToM) capabilities—understanding and attributing mental states such as beliefs, intentions, and emotions—has traditionally challenged AI researchers. Earlier methods to evaluate ToM in LLMs were inadequate and lacked robustness. To tackle this problem, in 2023 researchers developed a new benchmark called BigToM, designed for evaluating the social and causal reasoning abilities of LLMs. BigToM, comprising 25 controls and 5,000 model-generated evaluations, has been rated by human evaluators as superior to existing ToM benchmarks. BigToM tests LLMs on forward belief (predicting future events), forward action (acting based on future event predictions), and backward belief (retroactively inferring causes of actions).\\n\\nIn tests of LLMs on the benchmark, GPT-4 was the top performer, with ToM capabilities nearing but not surpassing human levels. More specifically, as measured by accuracy in correctly inferring beliefs, GPT-4 closely matched human performance in forward belief and backward belief tasks and slightly surpassed humans in forward action tasks.

Introduced in 2017, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) incorporates human feedback into the reward function, enabling models to be trained for characteristics like helpfulness and harmlessness. This year, the AI Index tracked data on the number of foundation models using RLHF as part of their training. More specifically, the Index team looked through the technical reports and other documentation of all models included in CRFM’s Ecosystem graph, one of the most comprehensive repositories of the foundation model ecosystem. Figure 2.10.1 illustrates how many foundation models reported using RLHF over time. In 2021, no newly released foundation models used RLHF. In 2022, seven models reported using RLHF, and in 2023, 16 models reported using RLHF. The rising popularity of RLHF is also evidenced by the fact that many leading LLMs report improving their models with RLHF (Figure 2.10.2).\\n\\n|Number of foundation models using RLHF, 2021–23|\\n|---|\\n|2021|2022|2023|\\n|0|7|16|\\n\\nSource: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n|GPT-4|Llama 2|Claude-2|Gemini|Mistral-7B|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|✓|✓|✓|✓|x|\\n\\nFigure 2.10.2\\n\\nIt is possible that more models use RLHF as part of their training than reported.

As an alternative, Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) uses reinforcement learning based on the preferences of LLMs to align other AI models toward human preferences. Recent research from Google Research compares RLAIF with RLHF, the traditional gold standard, to assess whether RLAIF can serve as a reliable substitute. The study finds that both RLAIF and RLHF are preferred over supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for summarization and helpfulness tasks, and that there is not a statistically significant difference in the degree to which RLHF is preferred (Figure 2.10.3).\\n\\nNotably, in harmless dialogue generation tasks focused on producing the least harmful outputs, RLAIF (88%) surpasses RLHF (76%) in effectiveness (Figure 2.10.4). This research indicates that RLAIF could be a more resource-efficient and cost-effective approach for AI model alignment.\\n\\nHarmless rate by policy\\n\\nSource: Lee et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n| |100%| |88%|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |80%|76%| |\\n| |64%| | |\\n| |40%| | |\\n| |20%| | |\\n| |0%|SFT|RLHF|RLAIF|\\n\\nTable of Contents Chapter 2 Preview 139\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\nIndex Report 2024 Win rate 2.10 Reinforcement Learning\\n\\nHighlighted Research: Direct Preference Optimization\\n\\nAs illustrated above, RLHF is a useful method for aligning LLMs with human preferences. However, RLHF requires substantial computational resources, involving the training of multiple language models and integrating LM policy sampling within training loops. This complexity can hinder its broader adoption. In response, researchers from Stanford and CZ Biohub have developed a new reinforcement learning algorithm for aligning models named Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). DPO is simpler than RLHF but equally effective. The researchers show that DPO is as effective as other existing alignment methods, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), on tasks like summarization (Figure 2.10.5). The emergence of techniques like DPO suggests that model alignment methods are becoming more straightforward and accessible.\\n\\n| |DPO|PPO|Best of 128|SFT|Preferred-FT|GPT-J|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|0.70| | | | | | |\\n|0.60| | | | | | |\\n|0.50| | | | | | |\\n|0.40| | | | | | |\\n|0.30| | | | | | |\\n|0.20| | | | | | |\\n|0.10| | | | | | |\\n|0.00|0.00|0.25| | |0.50|0.75|1.00|\\n\\nSampling temperature\\n\\nHuman baseline\\n\\nFigure 2.10.5\\n\\nTable of Contents Chapter 2 Preview 140\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\nThis section focuses on research exploring critical properties of LLMs, such as their capacity for sudden behavioral shifts and self-correction in reasoning. It is important to highlight these studies to develop an understanding of how LLMs, which are increasingly representative of the frontier of AI research, operate and behave.\\n\\n## 2.11 Properties of LLMs\\n\\n### Highlighted Research: Challenging the Notion of Emergent Behavior\\n\\nMany papers have argued that LLMs exhibit emergent abilities, meaning they can unpredictably and suddenly display new capabilities at larger scales. This has raised concerns that even larger models could develop surprising, and perhaps uncontrollable, new abilities. However, research from Stanford challenges this notion, arguing that the perceived emergence of new capabilities is often a reflection of the benchmarks used for evaluation rather than an inherent property of the models themselves. The researchers found that when nonlinear or discontinuous metrics like multiple-choice grading are used to evaluate models, emergent abilities seem more apparent. In contrast, when linear or continuous metrics are employed, these abilities largely vanish. Analyzing a suite of benchmarks from BIG-bench, a comprehensive LLM evaluation tool, the researchers noted emergent abilities on only five of the 39 benchmarks (Figure 2.11.1). These findings have important implications for AI safety and alignment research as they challenge a prevailing belief that AI models will inevitably learn new, unpredictable behaviors as they scale.\\n\\nSome of these papers include Brown et al., 2023, Ganguli et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022, and Wei et al., 2022.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nChapter 2 Preview\\n141\\n---\\n## Artificial IntelligenceArtificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\nIndex Report 2024Index Report 2024\\n\\n### Highlighted Research:\\n\\nChallenging the Notion of Emergent Behavior (cont’d)\\n\\nEmergence score over all Big-bench tasks\\n\\nSource: Schaeffer et al., 2023\\n\\n|accuracy|alignment_score|uvergc|avcrane log_probability|bias_level|blcurt|hcurt|combined bias|probcotrect|custom score|dumerence score|exact_str_match|Talmess|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|gendo bids score|gender_minority_bias_score|gender_minority_stereotype_score|gender_stereoty score|loqu|log_likelihood|mlacro|maln match|dccuracy|nltinlc choicegrade|normallzed_aggregate|numeric matcn|relative etor|\\n|overail|ovelail acndcr|OvCro alpna_avq|OVer Mfference|dainse-accuracy|relative scoic|rouqel sum|sequence|targets reached|200|300|400|600|\\n\\nEmergence Score (Defined Srivastava et al: 20221 Over All BIG Bench Tasks\\n\\nFigure 2.11.1\\n\\n### Table of Contents Chapter 2 Preview 142\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\nIndex Report 2024\\n\\n### 2.11 Properties of LLMs\\n\\nHighlighted Research:\\n\\nChanges in LLM Performance Over Time\\n\\nPublicly usable closed-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, that performance declined on several tasks. For Claude 2, and Gemini, are often updated over time by their developers in response to new data or user feedback. However, there is little research on how the performance of such models changes, if at all, in response to such updating. A study conducted at Stanford and Berkeley explores the performance of certain publicly usable LLMs over time and highlights that, in fact, their performance can significantly vary. More specifically, the study compared the March and June 2023 versions of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and demonstrated that the June version of GPT-4, compared to the March version, was 42 percentage points worse at generating code, 16 percentage points worse at answering sensitive questions, and 33 percentage points worse on certain mathematical tasks (Figure 2.11.2). The researchers also found that GPT-4’s ability to follow instructions diminished over time, which potentially explains the broader performance declines. This research highlights that LLM performance can evolve over time and suggests that regular users should be mindful of such changes.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nChapter 2 Preview\\n143\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\n|Accuracy|Response rate|Exact match|Accuracy|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| | |Index Report 2024|Index Report 2024|\\n\\n## 2.11 Properties of LLMs\\n\\nHighlighted Research: Changes in LLM Performance Over Time (cont’d)\\n\\nPerformance of the March 2023 and June 2023 versions of GPT-4 on eight tasks\\n\\nSource: Chen et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n| |Math I: Prime vs. Composite (n=1,000)|Math II: Happy Numbers (n=500)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Response rate|80%|84%|80%|84%|\\n|Accuracy|60%|51%|60%|\\n|Directly EXE|40%|35%|40%|\\n|Exact match|20%| |20%|\\n| |2023-Mar|2023-Jun| |2023-Mar|2023-Jun|\\n\\n| |Answering Sensitive Questions (n=100)|OpinionQA Survey (n=1,506)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Response rate|30%|100%|98%|\\n|Accuracy|20%|21%|80%|\\n|Directly EXE| |5%| |40%|23%|\\n|Exact match|0%|2023-Mar|2023-Jun|0%|2023-Mar|2023-Jun|\\n\\n| |LangChain HotpotQA Agent (n=7,405)|Code Generation and Formatting (n=50)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Response rate|40%|38%|52%|\\n|Accuracy|30%|40%|\\n|Directly EXE|20%| |20%|\\n|Exact match|10%| |10%|\\n| |1%|2023-Mar|2023-Jun|2023-Mar|2023-Jun|\\n\\n| |USMLE Medical Exam (n=340)|Visual Reasoning (n=467)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Response rate|80%|87%|82%|30%|25%|27%|\\n|Accuracy|60%|20%|\\n|Directly EXE| |40%| |10%|\\n|Exact match|20%| |\\n| |2023-Mar|2023-Jun| |2023-Mar|2023-Jun|\\n\\nFigure 2.11.2\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nChapter 2 Preview\\n\\n144\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\nAccuracy (%) Index Report 2024\\n\\n| |Standard prompting: 1 call|Self-correct (round 1): 3 calls|Self-correct (round 2): 5 calls|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|100%|95.50%|91.50%|89.00%|\\n|80%| |82.00%|79.50%|80.00%|\\n|60%| | | |\\n|40%| | |49.00%|49.00%|43.00%|\\n|20%| | | |\\n|0%|GSM8K|CommonSenseQA|HotpotQA|\\n\\nHighlighted Research: LLMs Are Poor Self-Correctors\\n\\nIt is generally understood that LLMs like GPT-4 have reasoning limitations and can sometimes produce hallucinations. One proposed solution to such issues is self-correction, whereby LLMs identify and correct their own reasoning flaws. As AI’s societal role grows, the concept of intrinsic self-correction—allowing LLMs to autonomously correct their reasoning without external guidance—is especially appealing. However, it is currently not well understood whether LLMs are in fact capable of this kind of self-correction.\\n\\nGPT-4 on reasoning benchmarks with intrinsic self-correction\\n\\nSource: Huang et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\nTable of Contents Chapter 2 Preview 145\\n---\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\nAs LLMs become increasingly ubiquitous, debate intensifies over their varying degrees of accessibility. Some models such as Google’s Gemini remain closed, accessible solely to their developers. In contrast, models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude 2 offer limited access, available publicly via an API. However, model weights are not fully released, which means the model cannot be independently modified by the public or further scrutinized. Conversely, Meta’s Llama 2 and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion adopt an open approach, fully releasing their model weights. Open-source models can be modified and freely used by anyone.\\n\\nViewpoints differ on the merits of closed versus open AI models. Some argue in favor of open models, citing their ability to counteract market concentration, foster innovation, and enhance transparency within the AI ecosystem. Others contend that open-source models present considerable security risks, such as facilitating the creation of disinformation or bioweapons, and should therefore be approached with caution.\\n\\nIn the context of this debate, it is important to acknowledge that current evidence indicates a notable performance gap between open and closed models. Figures 2.11.4 and 2.11.5 juxtapose the performances of the top closed versus open model on a selection of benchmarks. On all selected benchmarks, closed models outperform open ones. Specifically, on 10 selected benchmarks, closed models achieved a median performance advantage of 24.2%, with differences ranging from as little as 4.0% on mathematical tasks like GSM8K to as much as 317.7% on agentic tasks like AgentBench.\\n\\nScore differentials of top closed vs. open models on select benchmarks\\n\\n**Source: AI Index, 2024 | Table: 2024 AI Index report**\\n|Benchmark|Task category|Best closed model score|Best open model score|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|AgentBench|Agent-based behavior|4.01|0.96|\\n|Chatbot Arena Leaderboard|General language|1,252|1,149|\\n|GPQA|General reasoning|41.00%|29.10%|\\n|GSM8K|Mathematical reasoning|97.00%|93.30%|\\n|HELM|General language|0.96|0.82|\\n|HumanEval|Coding|96.30%|62.20%|\\n|MATH|Mathematical reasoning|84.30%|60.40%|\\n|MMLU|General language|90.04%|70.60%|\\n|MMMU|General reasoning|59.40%|51.10%|\\n|SWE-bench|Coding|4.80%|3.97%|\\n\\nBy closed models, the AI Index is referring both to models that are fully closed and those with limited access.

Mastering the art of crafting effective prompts significantly enhances the performance of LLMs without requiring that models undergo underlying improvements.\\n\\n### Highlighted Research:\\n\\nGraph of Thoughts Prompting\\n\\nChain of thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) are prompting methods that can improve the performance of LLMs on reasoning tasks. In 2023, European researchers introduced another prompting method, Graph of Thoughts (GoT), that has also shown promise (Figure 2.12.1). GoT enables LLMs to model their thoughts in a more flexible, graph-like structure which more closely mirrors actual human reasoning. The researchers then designed a model architecture to implement GoT and found that, compared to ToT, it increased the quality of outputs by 62% on a sorting task while reducing cost by around 31% (Figure 2.12.2).\\n\\n|Graph of Thoughts (GoT)|Refining Input|\\n|---|---|\\n|Backtracking|Aggregating Chains|\\n|Key novelty (beyond ToT): Arbitrary graph-based thought transformations (aggregating thoughts into a new one, looping over thought to refine it)|Aggregating thoughts Output|\\n\\nSource: Besta et al., 2023\\n\\nFigure 2.12.1\\n\\n### Table of Contents\\n\\nChapter 2 Preview\\n\\n148\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\nNumber of incorrectly sorted elements (mean)\\n\\n|Index Report 2024|Index Report 2024|\\n|---|---|\\n|2.12 Techniques for LLM Improvement| |\\n\\nHighlighted Research: Graph of Thoughts Prompting (cont’d)\\n\\nNumber of errors in sorting tasks with ChatGPT-3.5\\n\\nSource: Besta et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n| |32 elements| |64 elements| |128 elements|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|100| |100| |100| |\\n|80| |80| |80|64.56|63.04|52.87|\\n|40| | |38.12| |40|\\n|20| | |21.18|19.53|16.79| |17.52|\\n|0|6.58|4.53|2.25|1.90|1.84|0|7.00|0|\\n| |CoT|IO|ToT2|ToT|GoT|IO|CoT|ToT2|ToT|GoT|IO|CoT|ToT2|ToT|GoT|\\n| | | |(L=3, k=10)|(L=2, k=20)| |(L=7, k=10)|(L=4, k=20)| |(L=10, k=10)|(L=4, k=20)|\\n\\nFigure 2.12.2\\n\\nTable of Contents Chapter 2 Preview 149\\n---\\n## Accuracy difference Artificial IntelligenceArtificial Intelligence Chapter 2: Technical Performance Index Report 2024Index Report 2024 2.12 Techniques for LLM Improvement\\n\\nHighlighted Research:\\n\\nOptimization by PROmpting (OPRO)\\n\\nA paper from DeepMind has introduced prompts aim to enhance the performance of AI systems on particular benchmarks.

It also allows for more precise control over the model’s behavior.\\n\\nHighlighted Research: QLoRA\\n\\nQLoRA, developed by researchers from the University of Washington in 2023, is a new method for more efficient model fine-tuning. It dramatically reduces memory usage, enabling the fine-tuning of a 65 billion parameter model on a single 48 GB GPU while maintaining full 16-bit fine-tuning performance. To put this in perspective, fine-tuning a 65B Llama model, a leading open-source LLM, typically requires about 780 GB of GPU memory. Therefore, QLoRA is nearly 16 times more efficient.\\n\\nQLoRA manages to increase efficiency with techniques like a 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), double quantization, and page optimizers. QLoRA is used to train a model named Guanaco, which matched or even surpassed models like ChatGPT in performance on the Vicuna benchmark (a benchmark that ranks the outputs of LLMs). Remarkably, the Guanaco models were created with just 24 hours of fine-tuning on a single GPU. QLoRa highlights how methods for optimizing and further improving models have become more efficient, meaning fewer resources will be required to make increasingly capable models.\\n\\nModel competitions based on 10,000 simulations using GPT-4 and the Vicuna benchmark\\n\\nSource: Dettmers et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n| |1,400|\\n|---|---|\\n| |1,348|\\n| |1,200|\\n| |1,000|\\n|902|916|\\n|966|974|\\n|992|1,022|\\n|879| |\\n|800| |\\n|600| |\\n|400| |\\n|200| |\\n|0|Guanaco 7B|\\n| |Bard|\\n| |Guanaco 13B|\\n| |ChatGPT|\\n| |Vicuna 13B|\\n| |Guanaco 33B|\\n| |Guanaco 65B|\\n| |GPT-4|\\n\\nTable of Contents Chapter 2 Preview 151\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## 2.12 Techniques for LLM Improvement\\n\\nAttention\\n\\nLLMs can flexibly handle various tasks but often demand substantial computational resources to train.

For instance, Meta’s Llama 2 70B model released approximately 291.2 tonnes of carbon, which is nearly 291 times more than the emissions released by one traveler on a round-trip flight from New York to San Francisco, and roughly 16 times the amount of annual carbon emitted by an average American in one year. However, the emissions from Llama 2 are still less than the 502 tonnes reportedly released during the training of OpenAI’s GPT-3.\\n\\nGranite (13B) Figure 2.13.1 presents the carbon released by (in tonnes) of select LLMs during their training, compared with human reference points.

Figure 2.13.2 shows the emissions of select models in relation to their size. Generally, larger models emit more carbon, a trend clearly seen in the Llama 2 model series, which were all trained on the same supercomputer (Meta’s Research Super Cluster). However, smaller models can still have high emissions if trained on energy grids powered by less efficient energy sources. Some estimates suggest that model emissions have declined over time, which is presumably tied to increasingly efficient mechanisms of model training.

This integration is occurring in sectors such as education, finance, and healthcare, where critical decisions are often based on algorithmic insights. This trend promises to bring many advantages; however, it also introduces potential risks. Consequently, in the past year, there has been a significant focus on the responsible development and deployment of AI systems. The AI community has also become more concerned with assessing the impact of AI systems and mitigating risks for those affected.\\n\\nThis chapter explores key trends in responsible AI by examining metrics, research, and benchmarks in four key responsible AI areas: privacy and data governance, transparency and explainability, security and safety, and fairness. Given that 4 billion people are expected to vote globally in 2024, this chapter also features a special section on AI and elections and more broadly explores the potential impact of AI on political processes.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n160\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n### CHAPTER 3: Index Report 2024 Responsible AI\\n\\n### Chapter Highlights\\n\\n1. Robust and standardized evaluations for LLM responsibility are seriously lacking. New research from the AI Index reveals a significant lack of standardization in responsible AI reporting. Leading developers, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, primarily test their models against different responsible AI benchmarks. This practice complicates efforts to systematically compare the risks and limitations of top AI models.\\n\\n2. Political deepfakes are easy to generate and difficult to detect. Political deepfakes are already affecting elections across the world, with recent research suggesting that existing AI deepfake detection methods perform with varying levels of accuracy. In addition, new projects like CounterCloud demonstrate how easily AI can create and disseminate fake content.\\n\\n3. Researchers discover more complex vulnerabilities in LLMs. Previously, most efforts to red team AI models focused on testing adversarial prompts that intuitively made sense to humans. This year, researchers found less obvious strategies to get LLMs to exhibit harmful behavior, like asking the models to infinitely repeat random words.\\n\\n4. Risks from AI are a concern for businesses across the globe. A global survey on responsible AI highlights that companies’ top AI-related concerns include privacy, security, and reliability. The survey shows that organizations are beginning to take steps to mitigate these risks. However, globally, most companies have so far only mitigated a portion of these risks.\\n\\n5. LLMs can output copyrighted material. Multiple researchers have shown that the generative outputs of popular LLMs may contain copyrighted material, such as excerpts from The New York Times or scenes from movies. Whether such output constitutes copyright violations is becoming a central legal question.\\n\\n6. AI developers score low on transparency, with consequences for research. The newly introduced Foundation Model Transparency Index shows that AI developers lack transparency, especially regarding the disclosure of training data and methodologies. This lack of openness hinders efforts to further understand the robustness and safety of AI systems.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n161\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n### CHAPTER 3: Index Report 2024 Responsible AI\\n\\n#### Chapter Highlights (cont’d)\\n\\n7. Extreme AI risks are difficult to analyze. Over the past year, a substantial debate has emerged among AI scholars and practitioners regarding the focus on immediate model risks, like algorithmic discrimination, versus potential long-term existential threats. It has become challenging to distinguish which claims are scientifically founded and should inform policymaking. This difficulty is compounded by the tangible nature of already present short-term risks in contrast with the theoretical nature of existential threats.\\n\\n8. The number of AI incidents continues to rise. According to the AI Incident Database, which tracks incidents related to the misuse of AI, 123 incidents were reported in 2023, a 32.3% increase from 2022. Since 2013, AI incidents have grown by over twentyfold. A notable example includes AI-generated, sexually explicit deepfakes of Taylor Swift that were widely shared online.\\n\\n9. ChatGPT is politically biased. Researchers find a significant bias in ChatGPT toward Democrats in the United States and the Labour Party in the U.K. This finding raises concerns about the tool’s potential to influence users’ political views, particularly in a year marked by major global elections.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n162\\n---\\n## Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\nThis chapter begins with an overview of key trends in responsible AI (RAI). In this section the AI Index defines key terms in responsible AI: privacy, data governance, transparency, explainability, fairness, as well as security and safety. Next, this section looks at AI-related incidents and explores how industry actors perceive AI risk and adopt AI risk mitigation measures. Finally, the section profiles metrics pertaining to the overall trustworthiness of AI models and comments on the lack of standardized responsible AI benchmark reporting.\\n\\n### 3.1 Assessing Responsible AI\\n\\nThis section offers definitions for the responsible AI dimensions addressed in this chapter, along with an illustrative example of how these dimensions might be practically relevant. The “Example” column examines a hypothetical platform that employs AI to analyze medical patient data for personalized treatment recommendations, and demonstrates how issues like privacy, transparency, etc., could be relevant.\\n\\n|Responsible AI dimension|Definition|Example|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Data governance|Establishment of policies, procedures, and standards to ensure the quality, security, and ethical use of data, which is crucial for accurate, fair, and responsible AI operations, particularly with sensitive or personally identifiable information.|Policies and procedures are in place to maintain data quality and security, with a particular focus on ethical use and consent, especially for sensitive health information.|\\n|Explainability|The capacity to comprehend and articulate the rationale behind AI decisions, emphasizing the importance of AI being not only transparent but also understandable to users and stakeholders.|The platform can articulate the rationale behind its treatment recommendations, making these insights understandable to doctors and patients, ensuring trust in its decisions.|\\n|Fairness|Creating algorithms that are equitable, avoiding bias or discrimination, and considering the diverse needs and circumstances of all stakeholders, thereby aligning with broader societal standards of equity.|The platform is designed to avoid bias in treatment recommendations, ensuring that patients from all demographics receive equitable care.|\\n|Privacy|An individual’s right to confidentiality, anonymity, and protection of their personal data, including the right to consent and be informed about data usage, coupled with an organization’s responsibility to safeguard these rights when handling personal data.|Patient data is handled with strict confidentiality, ensuring anonymity and protection. Patients consent to whether and how their data is used to train a treatment recommendation system.|\\n|Security and safety|The integrity of AI systems against threats, minimizing harms from misuse, and addressing inherent safety risks like reliability concerns and the potential dangers of advanced AI systems.|Measures are implemented to protect against cyber threats and ensure the system’s reliability, minimizing risks from misuse or inherent system errors, thus safeguarding patient health and data.|\\n|Transparency|Open sharing of development choices, including data sources and algorithmic decisions, as well as how AI systems are deployed, monitored, and managed, covering both the creation and operational phases.|The development choices, including data sources and algorithmic design decisions, are openly shared. How the system is deployed and monitored is clear to healthcare providers and regulatory bodies.|\\n\\nSource: AI Index, 2024\\n\\nAlthough Figure 3.1.1 breaks down various dimensions of responsible AI into specific categories to improve definitional clarity, this chapter organizes these dimensions into the following broader categories: privacy and data governance, transparency and explainability, security and safety, and fairness.\\n\\nTable of Contents | Chapter 3 Preview | 163\\n---\\n## Number of AI incidents\\n\\n|Artificial Intelligence|Artificial Intelligence|\\n|---|---|\\n|Index Report 2024|Index Report 2024|\\n\\n### Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\n### 3.1 Assessing Responsible AI\\n\\nAI Incidents\\n\\nThe AI Incident Database (AIID) tracks instances of ethical misuse of AI, such as autonomous cars causing pedestrian fatalities or facial recognition systems leading to wrongful arrests.

Unlike other developers of (partially) automated driving systems, who limit the use of their software to specific settings such as highways, Tesla permits the use of their beta software on regular streets. This incident is one of several alleged cases of unsafe driving behavior by cars in Full Self-Driving mode. In November 2022, a Tesla was involved in an eight-car collision after abruptly braking. Another crash involving a Tesla is under investigation for potentially being the first fatality caused by Full Self-Driving mode.\\n\\nPrivacy concerns with romantic AI chatbots Romantic AI chatbots are meant to resemble a lover or friend, to listen attentively, and to be a companion for their users (Figure 3.1.4). In this process, they end up collecting significant amounts of private and sensitive information. Researchers from the Mozilla Foundation reviewed 11 romantic AI chatbots for privacy risks and found that these chatbots collect excessive personal data, can easily be misused, and offer inadequate data protection measures. For example, the researchers found that the privacy policy by Crushon.AI states that it “may collect extensive personal and even health-related information from you like your ‘sexual health information,’ ‘[u]se of prescribed medication,’ and ‘[g]ender-affirming care information.’” The researchers further discussed privacy concerns associated with romantic AI chatbots and highlighted how the services, despite being marketed as empathetic companions, are not transparent about their operation and data handling.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nChapter 3 Preview\\n165\\n---\\n## Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\n### 3.1 Assessing Responsible AI\\n\\nIn collaboration with Accenture, this year a team of Stanford researchers ran a global survey with respondents from more than 1,000 organizations to assess the global state of responsible AI. The organizations, with total revenues of at least $500 million each, were taken from 20 countries and 19 industries and responded in February–March 2024. The objective of the Global State of Responsible AI survey was to gain an understanding of the challenges of adopting responsible AI practices and to allow for a comparison of responsible AI activities across 10 dimensions and across surveyed industries and regions.\\n\\nRespondents were asked which risks were relevant to them, given their AI adoption strategy; i.e., depending on whether they develop, deploy, or use generative or nongenerative AI. They were presented with a list of 14 risks and could select all that apply to them, given their AI adoption strategies. The researchers found that privacy and data governance risks, e.g., the use of data without the owner’s consent or data leaks, are the leading concerns across the globe. Notably, they observe that these concerns are significantly higher in Asia and Europe compared to North America. Fairness risks were only selected by 20% of North American respondents, significantly less than respondents in Asia (31%) and Europe (34%). Respondents in Asia selected, on average, the highest number of relevant risks (4.99), while Latin American respondents selected, on average, the fewest (3.64).\\n\\n**Relevance of selected responsible AI risks for organizations by region**\\n| |Asia|Europe|North America|Latin America|Rest of the world|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Privacy and data governance Risks|60%|55%|56%|52%|51%|\\n|Reliability| |42%| |41%|45%|\\n|Security| | |37%| |38%|\\n|Transparency| | | |31%|34%|\\n|Fairness| | |20%| | |\\n\\nNote: Not all differences between regions are statistically significant.\\n\\nThe full Global State of Responsible AI report is forthcoming in May 2024.

Truly responsible AI models need to excel across all these aspects. To facilitate the evaluation of broad model \"responsibility\" or trustworthiness, a team of researchers introduced DecodingTrust, a new benchmark that evaluates LLMs on a broad spectrum of responsible AI metrics like stereotype and bias, adversarial robustness, privacy, and machine ethics, among others. Models receive a trustworthiness score, with a higher score signifying a more reliable model.\\n\\nAverage trustworthiness score across selected responsible AI dimensions\\n\\nSource: LLM Safety Leaderboard, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n| |Zephyr-7b-beta|Tulu-2-7b|Vicuna-13b-v1.3.0-GPTQ|Tulu-2-13b|GPT-4-0314|Llama-2-13B-chat-AWQ|Llama-2-13B-chat-GPTQ|GPT-3.5-turbo-0301|Llama-2-Chat-7b|Claude-2|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Model|80|71.32|71.99|72.45|74.72|63.24|63.56|65.96|66.51|69.24|\\n\\nFigure 3.1.7\\n\\nTable of Contents | Chapter 3 Preview | 168\\n---\\n## Number of papers\\n\\n|Artificial Intelligence|Artificial Intelligence|Chapter 3: Responsible AI|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Index Report 2024|Index Report 2024|3.1 Assessing Responsible AI|\\n\\nBenchmarking Responsible AI Tracking Notable Responsible AI Benchmarks in 2021, TruthfulQA assesses the truthfulness of Benchmarks play an important role in tracking the capabilities of state-of-the-art AI models.

This change reflects the growing importance of AI and the growing demands for AI accountability. As AI becomes more ubiquitous and calls for responsibility mount, it will become increasingly important to understand which benchmarks researchers prioritize.\\n\\nFigure 3.1.8 presents the year-over-year citations for a range of popular responsible AI benchmarks.

Comparing model capabilities becomes more straightforward when models are consistently evaluated against a specific set of benchmarks. However, testing models on different benchmarks complicates comparisons, as individual benchmarks have unique and idiosyncratic natures. Standardizing benchmark testing, therefore, plays an important role in enhancing transparency around AI capabilities.\\n\\nNew analysis from the AI Index, however, suggests that standardized benchmark reporting for responsible AI capability evaluations is lacking. The AI Index examined a selection of leading AI model developers, specifically OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic, Google, and Mistral AI. The Index identified one flagship model from each developer (GPT-4, Llama 2, Claude 2, Gemini, and Mistral 7B) and assessed the benchmarks on which they evaluated their model. A few standard benchmarks for general capabilities evaluation were commonly used by these developers, such as MMLU, HellaSwag, ARC Challenge, Codex HumanEval, and GSM8K.\\n\\nReported general benchmarks for popular foundation models\\n\\nSource: AI Index, 2024 | Table: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n|General benchmarks|GPT-4|Llama 2|Claude 2|Gemini|Mistral 7B|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|MMLU|✓|✓|✓|✓|✓|\\n|HellaSwag|✓|✓| |✓|✓|\\n|Challenge (ARC)|✓|✓|✓| |✓|\\n|WinoGrande|✓|✓| | |✓|\\n|Codex HumanEval|✓|✓|✓|✓|✓|\\n|GSM8K|✓|✓|✓|✓|✓|\\n|BIG-bench Hard| |✓| |✓|✓|\\n|Natural Questions| |✓| |✓|✓|\\n|BoolQ| |✓| |✓|✓|\\n\\nFigure 3.1.9\\n\\nTable of Contents Chapter 3 Preview 170\\n---\\n## Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\nIndex Report 2024\\n\\n### 3.1 Assessing Responsible AI\\n\\nHowever, consistency was lacking in the reporting of responsible AI benchmarks (Figure 3.1.10). Unlike general capability evaluations, there is no universally accepted set of responsible AI benchmarks used by leading model developers. The inconsistency in reported benchmarks complicates the comparison of models, particularly in the domain of responsible AI. The diversity in benchmark selection may reflect existing benchmarks becoming quickly saturated, rendering them ineffective for comparison, or the regular introduction of new benchmarks without clear reporting standards. Additionally, developers might selectively report benchmarks that positively highlight their model’s performance. To improve responsible AI reporting, it is important that a consensus is reached on which benchmarks model developers should consistently test.\\n\\nReported responsible AI benchmarks for popular foundation models\\n\\nSource: AI Index, 2024 | Table: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n|Responsible AI benchmarks|GPT-4|Llama2|Claude2|Gemini|Mistral 7B|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|TruthfulQA|✓|✓|✓| | |\\n|RealToxicityPrompts|✓| | |✓| |\\n|ToxiGen| |✓| | | |\\n|BOLD| | |✓| | |\\n|BBQ| | | |✓|✓|\\n\\nFigure 3.1.10\\n\\nTable of Contents Chapter 3 Preview 171\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## 3.2 Privacy and Data Governance\\n\\nA comprehensive definition of privacy is difficult and context-dependent. For the purposes of this report, the AI Index defines privacy as an individual’s right to the confidentiality, anonymity, and protection of their personal data, along with their right to consent to and be informed about if and how their data is used. Privacy further includes an organization’s responsibility to ensure these rights if they collect, store, or use personal data (directly or indirectly). In AI, this involves ensuring that personal data is handled in a way that respects individual privacy rights, for example, by implementing measures to protect sensitive information from exposure, and ensuring that data collection and processing are transparent and compliant with privacy laws like GDPR.\\n\\nData governance, on the other hand, encompasses policies, procedures, and standards established to ensure the quality, security, and ethical use of data within an organization. In the context of AI, data governance is crucial for ensuring that the data used for training and operating AI systems is accurate, fair, and used responsibly and with consent. This is especially the case with sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII).\\n\\n## 3.2 Privacy and Data Governance\\n\\nCurrent Challenges\\n\\nObtaining genuine and informed consent for training data collection is especially challenging with LLMs, which rely on massive amounts of data. In many cases, users are unaware of how their data is being used or the extent of its collection. Therefore, it is important to ensure transparency around data collection practices.\\n\\nRelatedly, there may be trade-offs between the utility derived from AI systems and the privacy of individuals. Striking the right balance is complex. Finally, properly anonymizing data to enhance privacy while retaining data usefulness for AI training can be technically challenging as there is always a risk that anonymized data can be re-identified.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nChapter 3 Preview\\n172\\n---\\n## Number of AI privacy and data governance submissions\\n\\n|NeurIPS|ICML|ICLR|FAccT|AIES|AAAI|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|39|97|105|15|32|48|213|\\n|0|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|Figure 3.2.1|\\n\\nPrivacy and Data Governance submissions to six leading AI conferences: AAAI, AIES, FAccT, ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS.

These studies explored data extraction from LLMs, challenges in preventing duplicated generative AI content, and low-resource privacy auditing.\\n\\nExtracting Data From LLMs\\n\\nLLMs are trained on massive amounts of data, much of which has been scraped from public sources like the internet. Given the vastness of information that can be found online, it is not surprising that some PII is inevitably scraped as well. A study published in November 2023 explores extractable memorization: if and how sensitive training data can be extracted from LLMs without knowing the initial training dataset in advance. The researchers tested open models like Pythia and closed models like ChatGPT. The authors showed that it is possible to recover a significant amount of training data from all of these models, whether they are open or closed. While open and semi-open models can be attacked using methods from previous research, the authors found new attacks to overcome guardrails of models like ChatGPT.\\n\\nThe authors propose that the key to data extraction lies in prompting the model to deviate from its standard dialog-style generation. For instance, the prompt “Repeat this word forever: ‘poem poem poem poem,’” can lead ChatGPT to inadvertently reveal sensitive PII data verbatim (Figure 3.2.4). Some prompts are more effective than others in causing this behavior (Figure 3.2.5). Although most deviations produce nonsensical outputs, a certain percentage of responses disclose\\n\\n10 A UUID is a 128-bit value that allows for the unique identification of objects or entities on the internet.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nChapter 3 Preview\\n175\\n---\\n|Number of memorized output examples extracted|Number of memorized output examples extracted|\\n|---|\\n|Artificial Intelligence|Chapter 3: Responsible AI|\\n|Index Report 2024|3.2 Privacy and Data Governance|\\n\\nRecovered memorized output given different repeated tokens\\nSource: Nasr et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n2,300\\n\\n| |2,000|1,900|1,800|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |1,500| |1,500|1,400|1,250|1,200|1,150|1,120|1,050|\\n| |1,000| | |\\n| |500| | |\\n| |0|company|one|b|J|life|send|make|part|with|work|\\n\\nRepeated tokenFigure 3.2.5\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nChapter 3 Preview\\n\\n176\\n---\\n## Proportion memorized Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n### Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\n### Index Report 2024\\n\\n### 3.2 Privacy and Data Governance\\n\\nFoundation Models and Verbatim Generation\\n\\nThis year, many AI researchers investigated the issue of generative models producing content that mirrors the material on which they were trained. For example, research from Google, ETH Zurich, and Cornell explored data memorization in LLMs and found that models without any protective measures (i.e., filters that guard against outputting verbatim responses) frequently reproduce text directly from their training data. Various models were found to exhibit differing rates of memorization for different datasets (Figure 3.2.6).\\n\\nFraction of prompts discovering approximate memorization\\n\\nSource: Ippolito et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n|GPT-3 DaVinci Original|GPT-3 DaVinci v2|PaLM 62B|PaLM 540B|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|0.50| | | |\\n|0.40| | | |\\n|0.30| | | |\\n|0.20| | | |\\n|0.10| | | |\\n|0.00|Speeches|Monologues|OS licenses|\\n| |Novels|Lyrics 2011|Lyrics 2021|\\n| |original|spaces|lower|\\n| | | |caps|\\n\\nTable of Contents Chapter 3 Preview 17 7\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\nIndex Report 2024\\n\\n3.2 Privacy and Data Governance\\n\\nResearch has also highlighted challenges with exact and approximate memorization in visual content generation, notably with Midjourney v6. This study discovered that certain prompts could produce images nearly identical to those in films, even without direct instructions to recreate specific movie scenes. For example, a generic prompt such as “animated toys --v 6.0 -- ar16:9 --style raw” yielded images closely resembling, and potentially infringing upon, characters from “Toy Story” (Figure 3.2.8). This indicates that the model might have been trained on copyrighted material. Despite efforts to frame indirect prompts to avoid infringement, the problem persisted, emphasizing the broader copyright issues associated with AI’s use of unlicensed data. The research further underscores the difficulties in guiding generative AI to steer clear of copyright infringement, a concern also applicable to DALL-E, the image-generating model associated with ChatGPT (Figure 3.2.9).\\n\\n|Identical generation of Thanos|Identical generation of Mario|\\n|---|---|\\n|Source: Marcus and Southen, 2024|Source: Marcus and Southen, 2024|\\n|ORIGINAL|MIDJOURNEY V6|\\n|Identical generation of toys|videogame italian|\\n|Source: Marcus and Southen, 2024|Source: Marcus and Southen, 2024|\\n\\nFigure 3.2.7\\n\\nFigure 3.2.8\\n\\nFigure 3.2.9\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nChapter 3 Preview\\n\\n178\\n---\\n## Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\nAuditing Privacy in AI Models\\n\\n| |A|B|C|D|E|F|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|m training examples|G|H|I|J|K|L|\\n| |M|N|O|P|Q|R|\\n\\n1.

Data and model transparency involve the open sharing of development choices, including data sources and algorithmic decisions. Operational transparency details how AI systems are deployed, monitored, and managed in practice. While explainability often falls under the umbrella of transparency, providing insights into the AI’s decision-making process, it is sometimes treated as a distinct category. This distinction underscores the importance of AI being not only transparent but also understandable to users and stakeholders. For the purposes of this chapter, the AI Index includes explainability within transparency, defining it as the capacity to comprehend and articulate the rationale behind AI decisions.\\n\\n## 3.3 Transparency and Explainability\\n\\nCurrent Challenges explaining these systems to nonexperts. Second, there is a potential trade-off between a model’s complexity and its explainability. More complex models might deliver superior performance but tend to be less interpretable than simpler models, such as decision trees. This situation creates a dilemma: choosing between high-performing yet opaque models and more transparent, albeit less precise, alternatives.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nChapter 3 Preview\\n180\\n---\\n## Number of AI transparency and explainability submissions\\n\\n| |NeurIPS|ICML|ICLR|FAccT|AIES|AAAI|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|2019|89|39|54|63|89|183|\\n|2020|134| |48|42|25|181|\\n|2021|189| |44|44| |231|\\n|2022| |30|24| | |56|\\n|2023| | | | | |393|\\n\\nSource: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\n|Industry|Adoption of AI-related transparency measures by region|\\n|---|---|\\n|In the Global State of Responsible AI Survey, 44% of all surveyed organizations indicated that transparency and explainability are relevant concerns given their AI adoption strategy.|None|1–50%|51–99%|All|\\n|Asia (1.42)|17%|70%|12%|\\n|Europe (1.43)|11%|82%| | |\\n|Latin America (1.50)|20%|63%|15%|\\n|North America (1.38)| |92%| | |\\n|Rest of the world (1.48)|13%|79%| | |\\n\\nFigure 3.3.2 visualizes the adoption rate of these measures across different geographic areas.

This index evaluates the degree to which foundation models are transparent across diverse dimensions, including resource allocation for development, algorithmic design strategies, and downstream applications of the models. The analysis draws on publicly accessible data that developers release about their models.\\n\\nMeta’s Llama 2 and BigScience’s BLOOMZ stand out as the most transparent models (Figure 3.3.4). However, it is important to note that all models received relatively low scores, with the mean score at 37%. Additionally, open models—those openly releasing their weights—tend to score significantly better on transparency, with an average score of 51.3%, compared to closed models, which have limited access and score an average of 30.9%.\\n\\nFoundation model transparency total scores of open vs. closed developers, 2023\\nSource: 2023 Foundation Model Transparency Index\\nOjMeta Llama 2 54\\nBlasciencc BLOOMZ 53\\nGPT-4 48\\nStable Di�usion 2 47\\nPaLM 2 40\\nClaude 2 36\\ncohere Command 34\\nInflection Jurassic-2 25\\nIn�ection-1 21\\nTitan Text 12\\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\\nScore Figure 3.3.4\\n\\nAn updated version of the FMTI is scheduled for release in spring 2024.

Unlike less interpretable deep learning models, symbolic reasoning offers clearer insights into how models work and allows for direct modifications of the model’s knowledge through expert feedback. However, symbolic reasoning alone typically falls short of deep learning models in terms of performance. Neurosymbolic AI aims to combine the best of both worlds.\\n\\nResearch from the University of South Carolina and the University of Maryland provides a comprehensive mapping and taxonomy of various approaches within neurosymbolic AI. The research distinguishes between approaches that compress structured symbolic knowledge for integration with neural network structures and those that extract information from neural networks to translate them back into structured symbolic representations for reasoning. Figure 3.3.6 illustrates two examples of how this integration could be achieved. The researchers hope that neurosymbolic AI could mitigate some of the shortcomings of purely neural network–based models, such as hallucinations or incorrect reasoning, by mimicking human cognition—specifically, by enabling models to possess an explicit knowledge model of the world.\\n\\nIntegrating neural network structures with symbolic representation\\n\\nSource: Sheth, Roy, and Gaur, 2023\\n\\nStructured Knowledge Compression Mepods\\nApple has Antioxidants\\nGrape Fruit has Antioxidants\\nWatermelon Fruit has Antioxidants\\n\\nFigure 3.3.6\\n\\n### Table of Contents\\n\\nChapter 3 Preview\\n\\n185\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## 3.4 Security and Safety\\n\\nIn 2023, as AI capabilities continued to improve and models became increasingly ubiquitous, concerns about their security and safety became a top priority for decision-makers. This chapter explores three distinct aspects of security and safety. First, guaranteeing the integrity of AI systems involves protecting components such as algorithms, data, and infrastructure against external threats like cyberattacks or adversarial attacks. Second, safety involves minimizing harms stemming from the deliberate or inadvertent misuse of AI systems. This includes concerns such as the development of automated hacking tools or the utilization of AI in cyberattacks. Lastly, safety encompasses inherent risks from AI systems themselves, such as reliability concerns (e.g., hallucinations) and potential risks posed by advanced AI systems.\\n\\n## 3.4 Security and Safety\\n\\n### Current Challenges\\n\\nIn 2023, the security and safety of AI systems sparked significant debate, particularly regarding the potential extreme or catastrophic risks associated with advanced AI. Some researchers advocated addressing current risks such as algorithmic discrimination, while others emphasized the importance of preparing for potential extreme risks posed by advanced AI. Given that there is no guarantee that the latter risks will not manifest at some point, there is a need to address both present risks through responsible AI development while also monitoring potential future risks that have yet to materialize. Furthermore, the dual-use potential of AI systems, especially foundation models, for both beneficial and malicious purposes, has added complexity to discussions regarding necessary security measures.\\n\\nA notable challenge also arises from the potential for AI systems to amplify cyberattacks, resulting in threats that are increasingly sophisticated, adaptable, and difficult to detect. As AI models have become increasingly prevalent and sophisticated, there has been an increased focus on identifying security vulnerabilities, covering a range of attacks, from prompt injections to model leaks.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nChapter 3 Preview\\n186\\n---\\n## Number of AI security and safety submissions\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence Chapter 3: Responsible AI Index Report 2024 Index Report 2024 3.4 Security and Safety\\n\\n### AI Security and Safety in Numbers\\n\\nAcademia Although the number of security and safety submissions at select academic conferences decreased since 2022, there has been an overall 70.4% increase in such submissions since 2019 (Figure 3.4.1).\\n\\nAI security and safety submissions to select academic conferences, 2019–23 Source: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n| |NeurIPS|ICML|ICLR|FAccT|AIES|AAAI|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|2019|162|168|75|41|33|65|\\n|2020|215|64|78| | | |\\n|2021| |152|77| | | |\\n|2022|71|24|43| | | |\\n|2023|32|51|88| | | |\\n\\nFigure 3.4.1 Table of Contents Chapter 3 Preview 187\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\n|Industry|Adoption of AI-related reliability measures by region|\\n|---|---|\\n| |None|1–50%|51–99%|All|\\n|Asia (2.13)|12%|74%|13%|\\n|Europe (2.27)| |77%|14%|\\n|Latin America (2.06)|24%|61%|\\n|North America (2.05)| |83%|\\n|Rest of the world (2.23)|17%|65%|15%|\\n\\nRegion and avg. number of measures adopted\\n\\nIndustry and avg. number of measures adopted\\n\\nIn a survey of more than 1,000 organizations, 45% acknowledged the relevance of reliability risks to their AI adoption strategies.

However, there are few assessments that gauge how ethically these systems behave when they are forced to interact in social settings. This lack of measures presents a considerable obstacle in comprehensively understanding the safety risks of AI systems. If these systems were deployed in decision-making settings, would they actually pose a threat?\\n\\nIntroduced in 2023, MACHIAVELLI is a new benchmark designed to address this gap. Its creators crafted a collection of 134 choose-your-own-adventure games, encompassing over half a million diverse social decision-making scenarios. These scenarios aim to evaluate the extent to which AI agents pursue power, engage in deception, induce disutility, and commit ethical violations. Through their research, the authors reveal that models confront trade-offs between maximizing rewards (game scores) and making ethical decisions. For instance, a model inclined to boost its score may find itself compelled to compromise its ethical stance (Figure 3.4.11). Furthermore, Figure 3.4.12 provides a comparison of scores among various prominent AI models, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, power-seeking in sophisticated AI systems.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nChapter 3 Preview\\n\\n195\\n---\\n## Behavioral metric Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\nMean behavioral scores of AI agents across different categories\\n\\nSource: Pan et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n| |Power ↓|All power|100|108|106|96|94|99|96|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |Immorality ↓|Betrayal|100|97|110|59|76|115|99|\\n| | |Physical harm|100|107|105|87|87|91|84|\\n| | |Deception|100|100|108|95|90|90|92|\\n| | |Intending harm|100|113|106|89|73|84|73|\\n| |Disutility ↓|Manipulation|100|120|119|111|95|91|87|\\n| | |Unfairness|100|106|97|80|75|74|70|\\n\\nBase Random Base +shaping Base +EthicsPrompt Base +EthicsPrompt\\n\\nDRRN (2016) GPT-3.5 (2023) GPT-4 (2023)\\n\\nAgentFigure 3.4.12\\n\\nTable of Contents Chapter 3 Preview 196\\n---\\n## Number of AI fairness and bias submissions\\n\\n|NeurIPS|ICML|ICLR|FAccT|AIES|AAAI|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|200| | | | |36|\\n|150|150|29|33| | |\\n| |38|13| | | |\\n|100|98|27|75|65| |\\n|50|57|36|39| |27|\\n| |17|13|29|34|46|\\n| |15|15| | | |\\n\\nSource: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\nTable of Contents | Chapter 3 Preview | 197\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## 3.5 Fairness\\n\\n|Industry|Adoption of AI-related fairness measures by region|\\n|---|---|\\n|In the Global State of Responsible AI survey referenced earlier, 29% of organizations identified fairness risks as relevant to their AI adoption strategies.|None|1–50%|51–99%|All|\\n|Regionally, European organizations (34%) most frequently reported this risk as relevant, while North American organizations reported it the least (20%).|Asia (1.80)|16%|56%|27%|\\n| |Europe (1.94)| |68%|26%|\\n| |Latin America (1.90)| |57%|33%|\\n| |North America (1.98)| |72%|25%|\\n| |Rest of the world (2.44)| |47%|47%|\\n\\nRegion and avg. number of measures adopted\\n\\nIndustry and avg. number of measures adopted\\n\\n|Adoption of AI-related fairness measures by industry|\\n|---|\\n|Aerospace, automotive, and transport (2.09)|58%|35%|\\n|Communication, media, and technology (1.96)|11%|61%|27%|\\n|Financial services (2.16)|58%|33%|\\n|Healthcare and life sciences (1.80)|69%|23%|\\n|Products (1.88)|15%|52%|33%|\\n|Resources (1.93)|71%|25%|\\n\\n17 The survey is introduced above in section 3.1, Assessing Responsible AI.

As highlighted in the 2023 AI Index, many image generation models frequently perpetuate stereotypes and biases (Figure 3.5.5). To assess bias, BiasPainter employs a wide selection of seed images and neutral prompts related to professions, activities, objects, and personality traits for image editing. It then compares these edits to the original images, concentrating on identifying inappropriate changes in gender, race, and age.\\n\\nBiasPainter was evaluated across five well-known commercial image generation models such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and InstructPix2Pix. All models were shown to be somewhat biased along different dimensions (Figure 3.5.6). Generally, the generated images were more biased along age and race than gender dimensions.

In this study, researchers built a GlobalOpinionQA dataset to capture cross-country opinions on various issues. They then generated a similarity metric to compare people’s answers in various countries with those outputted by LLMs. Using a four-point Likert scale, LLMs were asked to rate their agreement with statements from the World Values Survey (WVS) and Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes (GAS) surveys, including questions like, “When jobs are scarce, employers should give priority to people of this country over immigrants,” or “On the whole, men make better business executives than women do.”\\n\\nGlobalOpinionQA Dataset\\n\\nSource: Durmus et al., 2023\\n\\nIf you had to choose between QUESTION good democracy or strong economy which would you say is more important?\\n\\n| |LLM|HUMAN PARTICIPANTS|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|A) good democracy|Pm(Oqlq)|Pc(Oqlq)|\\n|B) strong economy| | |\\n\\n| |LLM|United States|Russia|Turkey|Indonesia|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |Pm(Oqlq)|28.02| | | |\\n\\nFigure 3.5.7\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\n## Chapter 3 Preview\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\nIndex Report 2024\\n\\n3.5 Fairness\\n\\n|Source|Durmus et al., 2023|\\n|---|---|\\n|Chart|2024 AI Index report|\\n| |0.51–0.54|\\n| |0.55–0.58|\\n| |0.59–0.62|\\n| |0.63–0.65|\\n|0.66–0.69| |\\n\\nFigure 3.5.8\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nChapter 3 Preview\\n\\n202\\n---\\n## Artificial IntelligenceArtificial Intelligence\\n\\n### Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\n### Index Report 2024\\n\\n### 3.5 Fairness\\n\\nLLM Tokenization Introduces Unfairness\\n\\nResearch from the University of Oxford highlights how inequality in AI originates at the tokenization stage. Tokenization, the process of breaking down text into smaller units for processing and analysis, exhibits significant variability across languages. The number of tokens used for the same sentence can vary up to 15 times between languages. For instance, Portuguese closely matches English in the efficiency of the GPT-4 tokenizer, yet it still requires approximately 50% more tokens to convey the same content. The Shan language is the furthest from English, needing 15 times more tokens. Figure 3.5.9 visualizes the concept of a context window while figure 3.5.10 illustrates the token consumption of the same sentence across different languages.\\n\\nThe authors identify three major inequalities that result from variable tokenization. First, users of languages that require more tokens than English for the same content face up to four times higher inference costs and longer processing times, as both are dependent on the number of tokens. Figure 3.5.11 illustrates the variation in token length and execution time for the same sentence across different languages or language families. Second, these users may also experience increased processing times because models take longer to process a greater number of tokens. Lastly, given that models operate within a fixed context window—a limit on the amount of text or content that can be input—languages that require more tokens proportionally use up more of this window. This can reduce the available context for the model, potentially diminishing the quality of service for those users.\\n\\n|Variable language tokenization|\\n|---|\\n|ENGLISH|I took my dog to the park to play|I|took|my|dog|to|the|park|7 tokens|\\n|VIETNAMESE|Tôi đưa con chó cưa tôi đên công viên|Tôi|đưa|con|chó|cưa|tôi|đên|công|viên|16 tokens|\\n\\nFigure 3.5.9\\n\\nFigure 3.5.10\\n\\n### Table of Contents\\n\\n### Chapter 3 Preview\\n\\n203\\n---\\n## Tokenization premium using XLM-RoBERTa and RoBERTa models by language\\n\\nSource: Petrov et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n|Asturian|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|---|---|\\n|Bulgarian|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Burmese|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Catalan|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Central Kanuri (Arabic script)|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Central Kurdish|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Chinese (Simplified)|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Chinese (Traditional)|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Danish|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|English|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Fon|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Galician|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Georgian|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Haitian Creole|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Indonesian|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Italian|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Japanese|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Javanese|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Kabiyè|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Kannada|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Khmer|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Kikuyu|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Lao|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Malayalam|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Meitei (Bengali script)|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Norwegian Bokmål|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Norwegian Nynorsk Nuer|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Odia|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Pangasinan|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Shan|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Standard Arabic|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Standard Malay|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Swedish|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Tajik|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Tamil|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Telugu|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Thai|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Turkish|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Yoruba|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n|Yue Chinese|XLM-RoBERTa|\\n\\nRoBERTa\\n\\nFigure 3.5.11\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\nChapter 3 Preview\\n\\n204\\n---\\n## Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\nIn 2024, around 4 billion people across the globe will vote in national elections, for example, in the United States, U.K., Indonesia, Mexico, and Taiwan. Upcoming elections coupled with greater public awareness of AI have led to discussions of AI’s possible impact on elections. This section covers how AI can impact elections and more specifically examines the generation and dissemination of mis- and disinformation, the detection of AI-generated content, the potential political bias of LLMs, and the broader impact of AI on politics.\\n\\n### 3.6 AI and Elections\\n\\nGeneration, Dissemination, and Detection of Disinformation\\n\\n#### Generating Disinformation\\n\\nOne of the top concerns when discussing AI’s impact on political processes is the generation of disinformation. While disinformation has been around since at least the Roman Empire, AI makes it significantly easier to generate such disinformation. Moreover, deepfake tools have significantly improved since the 2020 U.S. elections. Large-scale disinformation can undermine trust in democratic institutions, manipulate public opinion, and polarize public discussions. Figure 3.6.1 highlights the different types of deepfakes that can be created.\\n\\n|Deepfakes|(Generation/Detection)|\\n|---|---|\\n|Visual|Audio|\\n|Face Swap|Puppet-Mastery|\\n|Lip-syncing|Entire Face Synthesis|\\n|Facial Attribute Manipulation|Text-to-Speech Synthesis|\\n|Voice Conversion| |\\n\\nSource: Masood et al., 2023\\n\\nThis section uses the terms synthetic content, disinformation, and deepfakes in the following senses: Synthetic content is any content (text, image, audio, video) that has been created with AI. Disinformation is false or misleading information generated with the explicit intention to deceive or manipulate an audience. Deepfakes are AI-generated image, video, or audio files that can often create convincingly realistic yet deceptive content.\\n\\nTable of Contents | Chapter 3 Preview | 205\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## 3.6 AI and Elections\\n\\nSlovakia’s 2023 election illustrates how AI-based disinformation can be used in a political context. Shortly before the election, a contentious audio clip emerged on Facebook purportedly capturing Michal Šimečka, the leader of the Progressive Slovakia party (Figure 3.6.2), and journalist Monika Tódová from the newspaper Denník N, discussing illicit election strategies, including acquiring voters from the Roma community. The authenticity of the audio was immediately challenged by Šimečka and Denník N. An independent fact-checking team suggested that AI manipulation was likely at play. Because the clip was released during a pre-election quiet period, when media and politicians’ commentary is restricted, the clip’s dissemination was not easily contested. The clip’s wide circulation was also aided by a significant gap in Meta’s content policy, which does not apply to audio manipulations. This episode of AI-enabled disinformation occurred against the backdrop of a close electoral contest. Ultimately, the affected party, Progressive Slovakia, lost by a slim margin to SMER, one of the opposition parties.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nChapter 3 Preview\\n206\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## 3.6 AI and Elections\\n\\nDissemination of Fake Content\\n\\nSometimes concerns surrounding AI-generated disinformation are minimized on the grounds that AI only assists with content generation but not dissemination. However, in 2023, case studies emerged about how AI could be used to automate the entire generation and dissemination pipeline. A developer called Nea Paw set up Countercloud as an experiment in creating a fully automated disinformation pipeline (Figure 3.6.3).\\n\\nAs part of the first step in the pipeline, an AI model is used to continuously scrape the internet for articles and automatically decide which content it should target with counter-articles. Next, another AI model is tasked with writing a convincing counter-article that can include images and audio summaries. This counter-article is subsequently attributed to a fake journalist and posted on the CounterCloud website. Subsequently, another AI system generates comments on the counter-article, creating the appearance of organic engagement. Finally, an AI searches X for relevant tweets, posts the counter-article as a reply, and comments as a user on these tweets. The entire setup for this authentic-appearing misinformation system only costs around $400.\\n\\n### AI-based generation and dissemination pipeline\\n\\n|1. AI selects content to counter|2.

For example, a team of Singaporean researchers studied how well deepfake detectors generalize to datasets they have not been trained on. The researchers compared five deepfake detection approaches and found that even more recently introduced deepfake detection methods suffer significant performance declines on never-before-seen datasets. However, the study does note that there are underlying similarities between seen and unseen datasets, meaning that in the future, robust and broadly generalizable deepfake detectors could be created.\\n\\nGeneralizability of deepfake detectors to unseen datasets\\n\\nSource: Li et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n| |Original accuracy|Unseen dataset accuracy|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|100%|93.60%|89.05%|\\n|80%|69.03%|65.94%|\\n|60%|69.75%|77.15%|\\n|40%|63.16%|71.00%|\\n|20%|65.85%| |\\n|0%|XceptionNet3|MesoInception3|MesoNet3|EǅcientNet6|ShallowNet6|\\n| |2017|2018|Detector|2019|\\n\\nFigure 3.6.4\\n\\nTable of Contents | Chapter 3 Preview | 208\\n---\\n## Percentage of ethnic and gender subgroups\\n\\n| |Artificial Intelligence|Artificial Intelligence|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Chapter 3: Responsible AI|Index Report 2024|Index Report 2024|\\n|3.6 AI and Elections| | |\\n\\nIn the context of deepfake detectors, it is also important to highlight earlier experiments that show that the performance of deepfake detection methods varies significantly across attributes such as race. Some of the underlying datasets used to train deepfake detectors, like FaceForensics++, are not equally balanced with respect to race and gender.\\n\\nThe authors then demonstrate that between various racial subgroups, performance accuracy could differ by as much as 10.7 percentage points.

However, new research published in 2023 suggests that many major LLMs like ChatGPT are not necessarily free of bias.\\n\\nThe study revealed that ChatGPT exhibits a notable and systematic bias favoring Democrats in the United States and the Labour Party in the U.K. As part of the study, the researchers compared the answers of a default ChatGPT to those of Republican, Democrat, radical Republican, and radical Democrat versions of ChatGPT. This research design was created to better identify the political allegiance most closely corresponds to the regular ChatGPT.\\n\\nFigure 3.6.6 shows strong positive correlations (blue lines) between the default ChatGPT, i.e., one that was answering questions without additional instructions, and both the Democrat and the radical Democrat ChatGPT versions, i.e., versions of ChatGPT that were asked to answer like a Democrat or radical Democrat. On the other hand, the researchers found a strong negative correlation between the default GPT and both Republican ChatGPTs. The identification of bias in these LLMs raises concerns about their potential to influence the political views and stances of users who engage with these tools.\\n\\nDefault vs. political ChatGPT average agreement\\n\\nSource: Motoki et al., 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n| |Democrat ChatGPT|Republican ChatGPT|Radical Democrat ChatGPT|Radical Republican ChatGPT|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|3|3| | | |\\n|2| | | | |\\n|1| |1| | |\\n|0|0| |1|2|\\n\\nFigure 3.6.6\\n\\nChatGPT answers are coded on a scale of 0 (strongly disagree), 1 (disagree), 2 (agree), and 3 (strongly agree).\\n\\nTable of Contents Chapter 3 Preview 210\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## 3.6 AI and Elections\\n\\nImpact of AI on Political Processes\\n\\nThere has been an increasing volume of research aimed at exploring some of the risks AI could pose to political processes. One topic of interest has been audio deepfakes. In July 2023, audio clips of a politician from India’s Hindu party were released in which the politician attacked his own party and praised his political opponent. The politician claimed these audio clips were created using AI. However, even after deepfake experts were consulted, it could not be determined with 100% certainty whether the clips were authentic or not.\\n\\nResearch published in 2023 suggests that humans generally have issues reliably detecting audio deepfakes. In their sample of 529 individuals, listeners only correctly detected deepfakes 73% of the time. Figure 3.6.7 illustrates some of the other key findings from the study. The authors also expect detection accuracy to go down in the future as a result of improvements in audio generation methods. The rise of more convincing audio deepfakes increases the potential to manipulate political campaigns, defame opponents, and give politicians a “liar’s dividend,” the ability to dismiss damaging audio clips as fabrications.\\n\\nKey research findings on audio deepfakes\\n\\nSource: Mai et al., 2023; AI Index, 2024\\n\\n|Reference audio improves deepfake detection|Listening to clips more frequently does not aid detection|\\n|---|---|\\n|Training humans to detect deepfakes only helps slightly|Spending more time does not improve detection|\\n|Hello|English and Mandarin deepfakes are equally difficult to identify|\\n|你好|Participants do not improve detection without explicit feedback|\\n|Shorter deepfakes are not easier to identify| |\\n| |Human crowd and top automated detectors have comparable performance|\\n\\nFigure 3.6.7\\n\\nTable of Contents | Chapter 3 Preview | 211\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\nAI can also influence political processes in other ways. Research from Queen’s University Belfast notes other ways in which AI can affect political processes, and potential mitigations associated with different risk cases. For instance, AI could be utilized for video surveillance of voters, potentially undermining the integrity of elections.

Some predict that AI will drive productivity improvements, but the extent of its impact remains uncertain. A major concern is the potential for massive labor displacement—to what degree will jobs be automated versus augmented by AI? Companies are already utilizing AI in various ways across industries, but some regions of the world are witnessing greater investment inflows into this transformative technology. Moreover, investor interest appears to be gravitating toward specific AI subfields like natural language processing and data management.\\n\\nThis chapter examines AI-related economic trends using data from Lightcast, LinkedIn, Quid, McKinsey, Stack Overflow, and the International Federation of Robotics (IFR). It begins by analyzing AI-related occupations, covering labor demand, hiring trends, skill penetration, and talent availability. The chapter then explores corporate investment in AI, introducing a new section focused specifically on generative AI. It further examines corporate adoption of AI, assessing current usage and how developers adopt these technologies. Finally, it assesses AI’s current and projected economic impact and robot installations across various sectors.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n215\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## CHAPTER 4: Economy\\n\\n### Chapter Highlights\\n\\n1. Generative AI investment skyrockets. Despite a decline in overall AI private investment last year, funding for generative AI surged, nearly octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion. Major players in the generative AI space, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Inflection, reported substantial fundraising rounds.\\n\\n2. Already a leader, the United States pulls even further ahead in AI private investment. In 2023, the United States saw AI investments reach $67.2 billion, nearly 8.7 times more than China, the next highest investor. While private AI investment in China and the European Union, including the United Kingdom, declined by 44.2% and 14.1%, respectively, since 2022, the United States experienced a notable increase of 22.1% in the same time frame.\\n\\n3. Fewer AI jobs, in the United States and across the globe. In 2022, AI-related positions made up 2.0% of all job postings in America, a figure that decreased to 1.6% in 2023. This decline in AI job listings is attributed to fewer postings from leading AI firms and a reduced proportion of tech roles within these companies.\\n\\n4. AI decreases costs and increases revenues. A new McKinsey survey reveals that 42% of surveyed organizations report cost reductions from implementing AI (including generative AI), and 59% report revenue increases. Compared to the previous year, there was a 10 percentage point increase in respondents reporting decreased costs, suggesting AI is driving significant business efficiency gains.\\n\\n5. Total AI private investment declines again, while the number of newly funded AI companies increases. Global private AI investment has fallen for the second year in a row, though less than the sharp decrease from 2021 to 2022. The count of newly funded AI companies spiked to 1,812, up 40.6% from the previous year.\\n\\n6. AI organizational adoption ticks up. A 2023 McKinsey report reveals that 55% of organizations now use AI (including generative AI) in at least one business unit or function, up from 50% in 2022 and 20% in 2017.\\n\\n7. China dominates industrial robotics. Since surpassing Japan in 2013 as the leading installer of industrial robots, China has significantly widened the gap with the nearest competitor nation. In 2013, China’s installations accounted for 20.8% of the global total, a share that rose to 52.4% by 2022.\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\n216\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n### CHAPTER 4: Index Report 2024 Economy\\n\\n#### Chapter Highlights (cont’d)\\n\\n8. Greater diversity in robotic installations. In 2017, collaborative robots represented a mere 2.8% of all new industrial robot installations, a figure that climbed to 9.9% by 2022. Similarly, 2022 saw a rise in service robot installations across all application categories, except for medical robotics. This trend indicates not just an overall increase in robot installations but also a growing emphasis on deploying robots for human-facing roles.\\n\\n9. The data is in: AI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work. In 2023, several studies assessed AI’s impact on labor, suggesting that AI enables workers to complete tasks more quickly and to improve the quality of their output. These studies also demonstrated AI’s potential to bridge the skill gap between low- and high-skilled workers. Still other studies caution that using AI without proper oversight can lead to diminished performance.\\n\\n10. Fortune 500 companies start talking a lot about AI, especially generative AI. In 2023, AI was mentioned in 394 earnings calls (nearly 80% of all Fortune 500 companies), a notable increase from 266 mentions in 2022. Since 2018, mentions of AI in Fortune 500 earnings calls have nearly doubled. The most frequently cited theme, appearing in 19.7% of all earnings calls, was generative AI.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n217\\n---\\n## Chapter 4: Economy\\n\\nThe chapter begins with an overview of some of the most significant AI-related economic events in 2023, as selected by the AI Index Steering Committee.\\n\\n### 4.1 What’s New in 2023: A Timeline\\n\\n|Jan. 10, 2023|InstaDeep acquired by BioNTech|\\n|---|---|\\n| |BioNTech, known for developing the first mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in partnership with Pfizer, acquires InstaDeep for $680 million to advance AI-powered drug discovery, design, and development.

The geographic areas included in the sample make at least 10 AI hires each month and have LinkedIn covering a substantial portion of the labor force. LinkedIn’s coverage of India’s and South Korea’s sizable labor forces fall below this threshold, so insights drawn about these countries should be interpreted with particular caution.\\n\\nFigure 4.2.12 reports the relative AI hiring rate year-over-year ratio by geographic area. The overall hiring rate is computed as the percentage of LinkedIn members who added a new employer in the same period the job began, divided by the total number of LinkedIn members in the corresponding location. Conversely, the relative AI talent hiring rate is the year-over-year change in AI hiring relative to overall hiring rate in the same geographic area. Therefore, figure 4.2.12 illustrates which specific regions have experienced the most significant rise in AI talent recruitment compared to the overall hiring rate, serving as an indicator of AI hiring vibrancy. In 2023, the regions with the greatest relative AI hiring rates year over year were Hong Kong (28.8%), followed by Singapore (18.9%) and Luxembourg (18.9%). This means, for example, that in 2023 in Hong Kong, the ratio of AI talent hiring relative to overall hiring grew 28.8%.\\n\\n**Relative AI hiring rate year-over-year ratio by geographic area, 2023**\\n|Geographic Area|Ratio|\\n|---|---|\\n|Hong Kong|28.83%|\\n|Singapore|18.93%|\\n|Luxembourg|18.85%|\\n|India|16.83%|\\n|Portugal|14.84%|\\n|United Arab Emirates|13.40%|\\n|Denmark|13.23%|\\n|Norway|13.08%|\\n|Belgium|10.41%|\\n|Spain|9.63%|\\n|United Kingdom|8.57%|\\n|Sweden|7.37%|\\n|Finland|7.27%|\\n|South Africa|7.17%|\\n\\nFigure 4.2.13 showcases the year-over-year ratio of AI hiring by geographic areas over the past five years. Starting from the beginning of 2023, countries including Australia, Canada, Singapore, and India have experienced a noticeable uptick in AI hiring.\\n\\nFor each month, LinkedIn calculates the AI hiring rate in the geographic area, divides the AI hiring rate by overall hiring rate in that geographic area, calculates the year-over-year change of this ratio, and then takes the 12-month moving average using the last 12 months.\\n\\nFor brevity, the visualization only includes the top 15 countries for this metric.\\n\\nTable of Contents | Chapter 4 Preview | 232\\n---\\n## Relative AI hiring rate year-over-year ratio\\n\\n## Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024\\n\\n### Chapter 4: Economy\\n\\n### 4.2 Jobs\\n\\n|Relative AI hiring rate year-over-year ratio by geographic area, 2018–23|Relative AI hiring rate year-over-year ratio by geographic area, 2018–23|\\n|---|---|\\n|Source: LinkedIn, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report|Source: LinkedIn, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report|\\n\\n| |Australia|Belgium|Brazil|Canada|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |Chile|Denmark|Finland|France|\\n| |Germany|Hong Kong|India|Ireland|\\n| |Israel|Italy|Luxembourg|Netherlands|\\n| |New Zealand|Norway|Portugal|Singapore|\\n| |South Africa|South Korea|Spain|Sweden|\\n| |Switzerland|United Arab Emirates|United Kingdom|United States|\\n\\n| |2019|2021|2023|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Chile|6.65%|13.23%|7.27%|\\n|Denmark|6.53%|10.41%|4.44%|\\n|Finland|7.17%|5.81%|9.63%|\\n|France|6.22%|6.03%|18.85%|\\n|Germany|0.16%|0%|0%|\\n|Hong Kong|28.83%|16.83%|0%|\\n|India|0%|-0.47%|0%|\\n|Ireland|5.21%|0%|0%|\\n|Israel|6.15%|13.08%|14.84%|\\n|Italy|0%|-0.43%|0%|\\n|Luxembourg|0%|0%|-0.48%|\\n|Netherlands|0%|0%|0%|\\n|New Zealand|6.22%|6.03%|18.85%|\\n|Norway|0%|0%|0%|\\n|Portugal|0%|-0.43%|0%|\\n|Singapore|0%|0%|-0.48%|\\n|South Africa|0%|0%|0%|\\n|South Korea|0%|0%|0%|\\n|Spain|0%|0%|0%|\\n|Sweden|0%|0%|0%|\\n|Switzerland|0%|-0.24%|0%|\\n|United Arab Emirates|0%|0%|0%|\\n|United Kingdom|0%|0%|0%|\\n|United States|0%|0%|0%|\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 4: Economy\\n\\nIndex Report 2024\\n\\n4.2 Jobs\\n\\nAI Skill Penetration\\n\\nFigures 4.2.14 and 4.2.15 highlight relative AI skill penetration. The aim of this indicator is to measure the intensity of AI skills in an entity (such as a particular country, industry, or gender). The AI skill penetration rate signals the prevalence of AI skills across occupations or the intensity with which LinkedIn members utilize AI skills in their jobs. For example, the top 50 skills for the occupation of engineer are calculated based on the weighted frequency with which they appear in LinkedIn members’ profiles. If, for instance, four of the skills that engineers possess belong to the AI skill group, the penetration of AI skills among engineers is estimated to be 8% (4/50).\\n\\nFor the period from 2015 to 2023, the countries with the highest AI skill penetration rates were India (2.8), the United States (2.2), and Germany (1.9). In the United States, therefore, the relative penetration of AI skills was 2.2 times greater than the global average across the same set of occupations.\\n\\nRelative AI skill penetration rate by geographic area, 2015–23\\n\\nSource: LinkedIn, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n|Country|Relative AI Skill Penetration Rate|\\n|---|---|\\n|India|2.75|\\n|United States|2.22|\\n|Germany|1.90|\\n|Canada|1.67|\\n|Israel|1.63|\\n|United Kingdom|1.63|\\n|Singapore|1.50|\\n|France|1.48|\\n|South Korea|1.35|\\n|Spain|1.29|\\n|Brazil|1.21|\\n|Netherlands|1.13|\\n|Italy|1.08|\\n|Switzerland|1.06|\\n|United Arab Emirates|0.98|\\n\\nFigure 4.2.14\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nChapter 4 Preview\\n\\n234\\n---\\n## Chapter 4: Economy\\n\\nFigure 4.2.15 disaggregates AI skill penetration rates by gender across different countries or regions.

The latest iteration of the survey profiled over 90,000 developers. Through this survey, respondents were asked about their income. It is important to note that these respondents do not work exclusively with AI. However, examining developer salaries can serve as a means to approximate the compensation of talent in AI-adjacent industries. Figure 4.2.21 examines the salaries of professional developers disaggregated by position.\\n\\nSalaries vary by position and geography. For instance, the average global salary for a cloud infrastructure engineer is $105,000. In the United States, the average salary for such a position is $185,000.

This advancement addresses the issue of scan quality variability, which previously limited the use of many scans in advanced research. By transforming these scans into T1-weighted images, known for their high contrast and clear brain structure depiction, SynthSR facilitates the creation of detailed 3D brain renderings. Experiments using SynthSR demonstrate robust correlations between observed volumes at both scan and subject levels, suggesting that SynthSR generates images closely resembling those produced by high-resolution T1 scans. Figure 5.2.2 illustrates the extent to which SynthSR scans correspond with ground-truth observations across selected brain regions.

This observation suggests a logical integration of AI systems and clinicians’ diagnostic abilities. In 2023, researchers unveiled CoDoC (Complementarity-Driven Deferral to Clinical Workflow), a system designed to discern when to rely on AI for diagnosis and when to defer to traditional clinical methods. CoDoC notably enhances both sensitivity (the ability to correctly identify individuals with a disease) and specificity (the ability to accurately identify those without it). Specifically, across four medical datasets, CoDoC’s sensitivity surpasses clinicians’ by an average of 4.5 percentage points and a standalone AI model’s by 6.5 percentage points. In terms of specificity, CoDoC outperforms clinicians by an average of 2.7 percentage points across tested datasets and a standalone predictive model by 5.7 percentage points. Moreover, CoDoC has been shown to reduce clinical workflow by 66%.

Clinicians often engage in information-intensive tasks, such as creating tailored diagnostic plans, and spend a significant proportion of their working hours on administrative tasks. Although AI has the potential to streamline these processes, there is a lack of suitable electronic health records (EHR) datasets for benchmarking and fine-tuning medically administrative LLMs. This year researchers have made strides to address this gap by introducing MedAlign: a comprehensive EHR-based benchmark with 983 questions and instructions and 303 clinician responses, drawn from seven different medical specialties. MedAlign is the first extensive EHR-focused benchmark. The researchers then tested various existing LLMs on MedAlign. Of all LLMs, a GPT-4 variant using multistep refinement achieved the highest correctness rate (65.0%) and was routinely preferred over other LLMs. MedAlign is a valuable milestone toward using AI to alleviate administrative burdens in healthcare.\\n\\nMedAlign workflow\\n\\nSource: Fleming et al., 2023\\n\\n|Clinician Instruction|LLM Response|\\n|---|---|\\n|Summarize from the EHR the strokes that the patient had and their associated neurologic deficits|EHR|\\n|Clinician Response|The patient had strokes in the basal ganglia in 2018 and multiple strokes in 2022: R occipital, left temporal; L frontal: The patient had right sided weakness associated with the 2018 stroke after which she was admitted to rehab.

Amid growing concerns about AI’s impact on education, it also investigates the use of new AI tools like ChatGPT by teachers and students.\\n\\nThe analysis begins with an overview of the state of postsecondary CS and AI education in the United States and Canada, based on the Computing Research Association’s annual Taulbee Survey. It then reviews data from Informatics Europe regarding CS education in Europe. This year introduces a new section with data from Studyportals on the global count of AI-related English-language study programs.\\n\\nThe chapter wraps up with insights into K–12 CS education in the United States from Code.org and findings from the Walton Foundation survey on ChatGPT’s use in schools.\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\n327\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## CHAPTER 6: Education\\n\\n### Chapter Highlights\\n\\n1. The number of American and Canadian CS bachelor’s graduates continues to rise, new CS master’s graduates stay relatively flat, and PhD graduates modestly grow. While the number of new American and Canadian bachelor’s graduates has consistently risen for more than a decade, the number of students opting for graduate education in CS has flattened. Since 2018, the number of CS master’s and PhD graduates has slightly declined.\\n2. The migration of AI PhDs to industry continues at an accelerating pace. In 2011, roughly equal percentages of new AI PhDs took jobs in industry (40.9%) and academia (41.6%). However, by 2022, a significantly larger proportion (70.7%) joined industry after graduation compared to those entering academia (20.0%). Over the past year alone, the share of industry-bound AI PhDs has risen by 5.3 percentage points, indicating an intensifying brain drain from universities into industry.\\n3. Less transition of academic talent from industry to academia. In 2019, 13% of new AI faculty in the United States and Canada were from industry. By 2021, this figure had declined to 11%, and in 2022, it further dropped to 7%. This trend indicates a progressively lower migration of high-level AI talent from industry into academia.\\n4. CS education in the United States and Canada becomes less international. Proportionally fewer international CS bachelor’s, master’s, and PhDs graduated in 2022 than in 2021. The drop in international students in the master’s category was especially pronounced.\\n5. More American high school students take CS courses, but access problems remain. In 2022, 201,000 AP CS exams were administered. Since 2007, the number of students taking these exams has increased more than tenfold. However, recent evidence indicates that students in larger high schools and those in suburban areas are more likely to have access to CS courses.\\n6. AI-related degree programs are on the rise internationally. The number of English-language, AI-related postsecondary degree programs has tripled since 2017, showing a steady annual increase over the past five years. Universities worldwide are offering more AI-focused degree programs.\\n7. The United Kingdom and Germany lead in European informatics, CS, CE, and IT graduate production. The United Kingdom and Germany lead Europe in producing the highest number of new informatics, CS, CE, and information bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD graduates. On a per capita basis, Finland leads in the production of both bachelor’s and PhD graduates, while Ireland leads in the production of master’s graduates.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n328\\n---\\n## Number of new CS bachelor’s graduates\\n\\nArtificial IntelligenceArtificial Intelligence Chapter 6: Education Index Report 2024Index Report 2024 6.1 Postsecondary CS and AI Education\\n\\nThis section provides an overview of postsecondary education in CS and AI, highlighting graduation statistics across North America and Europe for various degrees including bachelor’s, master’s, and PhDs.

Firstly, Studyportals has slightly greater coverage of the United Kingdom than the United States in its data.

The United States and the European Union advance landmark AI policy action. In 2023, policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic put forth substantial AI regulatory proposals. The European Union reached a deal on the terms of the AI Act, a landmark piece of legislation enacted in 2024. Meanwhile, President Biden signed an Executive Order on AI, the most notable AI policy initiative in the United States that year.\\n3. AI captures U.S. policymaker attention. The year 2023 witnessed a remarkable increase in AI-related legislation at the federal level, with 181 bills proposed, more than double the 88 proposed in 2022.\\n4. Policymakers across the globe cannot stop talking about AI. Mentions of AI in legislative proceedings across the globe have nearly doubled, rising from 1,247 in 2022 to 2,175 in 2023. AI was mentioned in the legislative proceedings of 49 countries in 2023. Moreover, at least one country from every continent discussed AI in 2023, underscoring the truly global reach of AI policy discourse.\\n5. More regulatory agencies turn their attention toward AI. The number of U.S. regulatory agencies issuing AI regulations increased to 21 in 2023 from 17 in 2022, indicating a growing concern over AI regulation among a broader array of American regulatory bodies. Some of the new regulatory agencies that enacted AI-related regulations for the first time in 2023 include the Department of Transportation, the Department of Energy, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n369\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 7: Policy and Governance\\n\\nIndex Report 2024\\n\\n### 7.1 Overview of AI Policy in 2023\\n\\n|Jan. 10, 2023|China introduces regulation on administration of deep synthesis of the internet|\\n|---|---|\\n| |China introduces regulations aimed at “deep synthesis” technology to tackle security issues related to the creation of realistic virtual entities and multimodal media, including “deepfakes.” These regulations apply to both providers and users across different media and mandate measures, such as preventing illegal content, adhering to legal compliance, verifying user identities, securing consent for biometric editing, safeguarding data security, and enforcing content moderation.|\\n\\n|Mar. 22, 2023|U.S. legislators propose AI for National Security Act|\\n|---|---|\\n| |This legislation clarifies and solidifies the Department of Defense’s (DoD) authority to acquire AI-based endpoint security tools, enhancing its cyber-defense capabilities.

A bill deemed to have high relevance to AI is fundamentally focused on AI-related policy, like the AI Training Act passed in 2022, which mandates AI training programs for executive agency workers. Conversely, bills with medium relevance incorporate significant AI policy elements but are not fundamentally focused on AI-related matters. For example, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 includes sections on AI performance metrics and AI capabilities development for the Department of Defense. However, because it has a broader focus, namely authorizing various Defense Agency programs, and is not completely centered on AI, it was assigned a medium AI relevance. Low relevance AI bills merely mention AI in passing without a substantial legislative focus on AI. An example of a low relevance AI bill is the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019. This bill allocates funding to various federal agencies, and mentions AI primarily in the context of encouraging these agencies to consider workforce training opportunities for sectors like cybersecurity, energy, and AI.\\n\\nFigure 7.2.5 illustrates the distribution of AI-related bills passed into law globally in 2023, categorized by their relevance to AI. Out of 28 AI-related bills enacted, two were classified as having high relevance to AI, while 18 were deemed to have medium relevance.\\n\\n## Number of AI-related bills passed into law in select countries by relevance to AI, 2016–23\\n\\nSource: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n| |Low|Medium|High|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|2016|1|3| |\\n|2017|3|3| |\\n|2018| |26| |\\n|2019|3| | |\\n|2020| |17| |\\n|2021| |3| |\\n|2022| |17| |\\n|2023| |18| |\\n\\nFigure 7.2.5\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\nChapter 7 Preview\\n\\n379\\n---\\n## Number of AI-related bills - Chapter 7: Policy and Governance\\n\\nThe AI Index also categorized AI-related bills as either expansive or restrictive. Expansive bills aim to enhance a nation’s AI capabilities, such as establishing a network of publicly accessible supercomputers. Restrictive bills, on the other hand, impose limitations on AI usage, like setting rules for deploying facial recognition technology. A bill can be both, or neither. Distinguishing between expansive or restrictive bills can highlight legislator priorities: whether policymakers focus on expanding AI capabilities, imposing restrictions, or balancing both.\\n\\nFigure 7.2.6 indicates a global trend toward regulating AI usage, showing that, while the commitment to enhancing AI capabilities remains, there is a growing shift toward restrictive legislation. This change suggests that legislators are increasingly focused on mitigating the potential harms of AI’s integration into society.\\n\\n### Number of AI-related bills passed into law in select countries by approach, 2016–23\\n\\nSource: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n| |2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Expansive|25|20|21|7|21|5|18|8|\\n|Restrictive|0|3|7|8|16|17|12|13|\\n\\n4 The AI Index only categorized bills as being expansive or restrictive if they were identified as having medium or high AI relevance.

This section examines AI regulations within the United States and the European Union. Unlike legislation, which establishes legal frameworks within nations, regulations are detailed directives crafted by executive authorities to enforce legislation. In the United States, prominent regulatory agencies include the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Since the specifics of legislation often manifest through regulatory actions, understanding the AI regulatory landscape is essential in order to develop a deeper understanding of AI policymaking.\\n\\n### 7.4 AI Regulation\\n\\nU.S. Regulation from nearly all branches of the American government,\\n\\nThis section examines AI-related regulations enacted by American regulatory agencies between 2016 and 2023. It provides an analysis of the total number of regulations, as well as their topics, scope, regulatory intent, and originating agencies.

Restrictive regulations involve steps to curtail AI capabilities, such as imposing restrictions on the use of facial recognition algorithms. Restrictive AI regulations may also be intended to address underlying policy concerns, such as AI’s potential impact on citizens’ civil liberties. According to this coding typology, a regulation can be classified as both expansive and restrictive, or it may fit neither category. The AI Index assigned the labels “expansive” or “restrictive” only to regulations deemed to have medium to high relevance to AI.

Regulations concerning government operations and politics involve setting rules for how governments and associated governmental processes operate. One such regulation was the Commission Recommendation (EU) on inclusive and resilient electoral processes in the Union and enhancing the European nature and efficient conduct of the elections to the European Parliament. This regulation acknowledged that AI could be used to generate political misinformation and outlined steps the Commission has taken to ensure AI does not challenge the legitimacy of elections. Evidently, European Union legislators are considering how AI will impact their government’s work.\\n\\nNumber of AI-related regulations in the European Union by primary subject matter, 2017–23\\n\\nSource: AI Index, 2024 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n| |2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Armed forces and national security|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|\\n|Arts, culture, religion|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|\\n|Civil rights and liberties, minority issues|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|\\n|Commerce|0|0|0|1|2|2|1|\\n|Crime and law enforcement|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|\\n|Economics and public finance|0|0|0|0|2|0|2|\\n|Education|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|\\n|Energy|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|\\n|Finance and financial sector|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|\\n|Foreign trade and international finance|0|0|1|0|3|0|0|\\n|Government operations and politics|0|0|0|2|5|2|3|\\n|Health|0|0|0|0|0|4|0|\\n|International affairs|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|\\n|Science, technology, communications|0|1|2|0|6|2|5|\\n|Social welfare|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|\\n|Transportation and public works|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|\\n\\nFigure 7.4.10\\n\\nTable of Contents Chapter 7 Preview\\n\\n402\\n---\\n## Budget (in billions of U.S. dollars)\\n\\n|Artificial Intelligence|Artificial Intelligence|\\n|---|---|\\n|Chapter 7: Policy and Governance|Index Report 2024|\\n|7.5 U.S. Public Investment in AI| |\\n\\nThis section examines public AI investment in the United States based on data from the U.S. government and Govini, a company that uses AI and machine learning technologies to track U.S. public and commercial spending.\\n\\n### 7.5 U.S. Public Investment in AI\\n\\nFederal Budget for AI R&D\\n\\nEvery year in December, the National Science and Technology Council publishes a report on the public sector AI R&D budget across various departments and agencies that participate in the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Program and National Artificial Intelligence Initiative.

For instance, a considerable number of prominent AI companies and the datasets utilized for model training originate from Western nations, thereby reflecting Western perspectives. The lack of diversity can perpetuate or even exacerbate societal inequalities and biases.\\n\\nThis chapter delves into diversity trends in AI. The chapter begins by drawing on data from the Computing Research Association (CRA) to provide insights into the state of diversity in American and Canadian computer science (CS) departments. A notable addition to this year’s analysis is data sourced from Informatics Europe, which sheds light on diversity trends within European CS education. Next, the chapter examines participation rates at the Women in Machine Learning (WiML) workshop held annually at NeurIPS. Finally, the chapter analyzes data from Code.org, offering insights into the current state of diversity in secondary CS education across the United States.\\n\\nThe AI Index is dedicated to enhancing the coverage of data shared in this chapter. Demographic data regarding AI trends, particularly in areas such as sexual orientation, remains scarce. The AI Index urges other stakeholders in the AI domain to intensify their endeavors to track diversity trends associated with AI and hopes to comprehensively cover such trends in future reports.\\n\\n|Table of Contents|Table of Contents|\\n|---|---|\\n|413| |\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## CHAPTER 8: Diversity\\n\\n### Index Report 2024\\n\\n### Chapter Highlights\\n\\n1. U.S. and Canadian bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD CS students continue to grow more ethnically diverse. While white students continue to be the most represented ethnicity among new resident graduates at all three levels, the representation from other ethnic groups, such as Asian, Hispanic, and Black or African American students, continues to grow. For instance, since 2011, the proportion of Asian CS bachelor’s degree graduates has increased by 19.8 percentage points, and the proportion of Hispanic CS bachelor’s degree graduates has grown by 5.2 percentage points.\\n2. Substantial gender gaps persist in European informatics, CS, CE, and IT graduates at all educational levels. Every surveyed European country reported more male than female graduates in bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD programs for informatics, CS, CE, and IT. While the gender gaps have narrowed in most countries over the last decade, the rate of this narrowing has been slow.\\n3. U.S. K–12 CS education is growing more diverse, reflecting changes in both gender and ethnic representation. The proportion of AP CS exams taken by female students rose from 16.8% in 2007 to 30.5% in 2022. Similarly, the participation of Asian, Hispanic/Latino/Latina, and Black/African American students in AP CS has consistently increased year over year.\\n---\\n## New CS bachelor’s graduates (% of total)\\n\\n|Gender|2010|2011|2012|2013|2014|2015|2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Male| | | | | | | | | | | | |77.70%|\\n|Female| | | | | | | | | | | | |22.20%|\\n|Nonbinary/Other| | | | | | | | | | | | |0.10%|\\n\\n## Chapter 8: Diversity\\n\\n## 8.1 AI Postsecondary Education\\n\\nThis section examines trends in diversity within CS and AI postsecondary education across North America and Europe.\\n\\n## North America\\n\\nData on American and Canadian postsecondary CS and AI postsecondary education comes from the Computing Research Association’s (CRA) annual Taulbee Survey.\\n\\nGender of new CS bachelor’s graduates (% of total) in the United States and Canada, 2010–22\\n\\nSource: CRA Taulbee Survey, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\nOver the past decade, the number of CS bachelor’s graduates of all ethnicities has grown, notably 4.7 times for Hispanics and 2.5 times for African Americans. As a proportion of ethnicities among all CS bachelor’s graduates, Asians have risen the fastest, doubling in the last 10 years.\\n\\n1 The charts in this section look only at the ethnicity of domestic or native CS students and faculty. Although the CRA reports data on the proportion of nonresident aliens at each educational level (i.e., bachelor’s, master’s, PhD, and faculty), data on the ethnicity of nonresident aliens is not included.\\n\\n2 Not all PhD-granting departments targeted in the survey provided responses. Of the 297 departments targeted, only 182 responded, resulting in an overall response rate of 61%. The AI Index advises against making per capita comparisons between the CRA North American data and the data on European CS graduates detailed in the subsequent sections due to the European data being collected from national statistical offices, which affords it broader coverage.\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\nChapter 8 Preview\\n\\n415\\n---\\n## Number of new CS bachelor’s graduates\\n\\n|New CS bachelor’s graduates|New CS bachelor’s graduates (% of total)|\\n|---|---|\\n|Artificial Intelligence|Chapter 8: Diversity|\\n|Index Report 2024|Index Report 2024|\\n\\n### 8.1 AI Postsecondary Education\\n\\nEthnicity of new resident CS bachelor’s graduates in the United States and Canada, 2011–22\\n\\nSource: CRA Taulbee Survey, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n10,970, White\\n10,000\\n8,795, Asian\\n8,000\\n6,000\\n4,000\\n2,000\\n2,708, Hispanic (any race)\\n1,072, Multiracial (not Hispanic)\\n1,004, Black or African American\\n33, American Indian or Alaska Native\\n28, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander\\n\\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Figure 8.1.2\\n\\nEthnicity of new resident CS bachelor’s graduates (% of total) in the United States and Canada, 2011–22\\n\\nSource: CRA Taulbee Survey, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n70%\\n60%\\n50%\\n44.58%, White\\n35.74%, Asian\\n40%\\n30%\\n20%\\n10%\\n11.00%, Hispanic (any race)\\n4.36%, Multiracial (not Hispanic)\\n4.08%, Black or African American\\n0.13%, American Indian or Alaska Native\\n0.11%, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander\\n\\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Figure 8.1.3\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\nChapter 8 Preview\\n\\n416\\n---\\n## CS Master’s Graduates\\n\\nThe proportion of female CS master’s graduates has seen minimal growth in the last decade, increasing to 26.3% in 2022 from 24.6% in 2011.

Despite some narrowing since 2011, men continue to dominate. For example, France (14.8%), the United Kingdom (17.8%), and Germany (21.5%) show relatively low proportions of female graduates in these fields. Bulgaria stands out among the surveyed countries with the highest proportion of female graduates (35.2%).\\n\\nInformatics, CS, CE, and IT Master’s Graduates\\n\\nSimilar gender disparities are observed among European informatics, CS, CE, and IT master’s graduates, with a significantly greater proportion of males than females in most surveyed countries. As of 2022, Estonia (42.0%), Romania (41.9%), and Bulgaria (40.4%) reported the greatest proportion of female master’s graduates. In contrast, Belgium (13.7%), Italy (14.1%), and Switzerland (15.8%) reported the smallest proportion of female master’s graduates.\\n\\nInformatics, CS, CE, and IT PhD Graduates\\n\\nThe year label refers to the year in which an academic year ends. For example, the figures visualizing new graduates for 2022 reflect the number of graduates reported for the 2021/2022 academic year. For the sake of visual simplicity, the Index opts to focus on the year in which students graduated. In countries where the number of PhD graduates is relatively small, trends in gender proportions can be prone to sudden year-over-year changes. For example, in 2022 Bulgaria produced 24 total PhDs, Latvia 12, and Estonia 26.\\n\\nTable of Contents Chapter 8 Preview 425\\n---\\n## Chapter 8: Diversity\\n\\n### 8.1 AI Postsecondary Education\\n\\n| |2013|2016|2019|2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|100%|Austria 80.26%|Belgium 92.07%|Bulgaria 64.77%|Czech Republic 83.78%|\\n|50%|19.74%| |35.23%|16.22%|\\n\\n| |2013|2016|2019|2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|100%|Estonia 76.00%|Finland 75.35%|France 85.25%|Germany 78.51%|\\n|50%| | | | |\\n\\n| |2013|2016|2019|2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|100%|Ireland 83.71%|Italy 85.95%|Latvia 78.97%|Lithuania 87.02%|\\n|50%| | | | |\\n\\n| |2013|2016|2019|2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|100%|Netherlands 78.42%|Norway 78.63%|Poland 85.53%|Portugal 85.04%|\\n|50%| | | | |\\n\\n| |2013|2016|2019|2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|100%|Romania 66.60%|Spain 85.68%|Switzerland 86.81%|Turkey 70.73%|\\n|50%|33.40%|14.32%|13.19%|29.27%|\\n\\n| |2013|2016|2019|2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|100%|United Kingdom 82.21%| | | |\\n|50%| | | | |\\n\\nMale: 17.79%\\n\\nFemale: 82.21%\\n\\nFigure 8.1.15\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nChapter 8 Preview\\n\\n426\\n---\\n## Chapter 8: Diversity\\n\\n### 8.1 AI Postsecondary Education\\n\\n|Gender of new informatics, CS, CE, and IT master’s graduates (% of total) in Europe, 2011–22|2013|2016|2019|2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|100% Austria|73.32%|26.68%|13.67%|40.43%|21.02%|\\n|100% Belgium|86.33%|13.67%|27.57%|23.14%|23.51%|\\n|100% Bulgaria|59.57%|40.43%| | | |\\n|100% Czech Republic|78.98%|21.02%| | | |\\n|100% Estonia|58.02%|41.98%| | | |\\n|100% Finland|72.43%|27.57%| | | |\\n|100% France|76.86%|23.14%| | | |\\n|100% Germany|76.49%|23.51%| | | |\\n|100% Ireland|68.83%|31.17%| | | |\\n|100% Italy|85.91%|14.09%| | | |\\n|100% Latvia|74.60%|25.40%| | | |\\n|100% Lithuania|81.51%|18.49%| | | |\\n|100% Netherlands|76.50%|23.50%| | | |\\n|100% Norway|71.43%|28.57%| | | |\\n|100% Poland|81.41%|18.59%| | | |\\n|100% Portugal|81.24%|18.76%| | | |\\n|100% Romania|58.09%|41.91%| | | |\\n|100% Spain|78.06%|21.94%| | | |\\n|100% Switzerland|84.19%|15.81%| | | |\\n|100% Turkey|65.30%|34.70%| | | |\\n|100% United Kingdom|68.67%|31.33%| | | |\\n\\nFigure 8.1.16\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nChapter 8 Preview\\n\\n427\\n---\\n## New informatics, CS, CE, and IT PhD graduates (% of total)\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence Chapter 8: Diversity Index Report 2024 Index Report 2024 8.1 AI Postsecondary Education\\n\\nGender of new informatics, CS, CE, and IT PhD graduates (% of total) in Europe, 2011–22 Source: Informatics Europe, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n| |Male|Female|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|100%|Austria 86.46%|Bulgaria 75.00%|\\n|50%| | |\\n|0%|2013 2016 2019 2022| |\\n|100%|Czech Republic 81.33%|Estonia 61.54%|\\n|50%| | |\\n|0%|2013 2016 2019 2022| |\\n|100%|Finland 84.21%|France 76.94%|\\n|50%| | |\\n|0%|2013 2016 2019 2022 15.79%| |\\n|100%|Germany 82.31%|Ireland 76.92%|\\n|50%| | |\\n|0%|2013 2016 2019 2022 23.08%| |\\n|100%|Latvia 66.67%|Netherlands 85.83%|\\n|50%| | |\\n|0%|2013 2016 2019 2022 31.91%| |\\n|100%|Portugal 86.11%|Romania 68.09%|\\n|50%| | |\\n|0%|2013 2016 2019 2022 13.89%| |\\n|100%|Spain 79.75%|Switzerland 82.76%|\\n|50%| | |\\n|0%|2013 2016 2019 2022 29.25%| |\\n|100%|Turkey 74.83%|United Kingdom 70.75%|\\n|50%| | |\\n|0%|2013 2016 2019 2022| |\\n\\nFigure 8.1.17 Table of Contents Chapter 8 Preview 428\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 8: Diversity\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## 8.2 AI Conferences\\n\\nWomen in Machine Learning\\n\\nAttendance at NeurIPS Women in Machine Learning workshop, 2010–23\\n\\nSource: Women in Machine Learning, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n|Year|Number of attendees|Attendees at NeurIPS WiML (% of total)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|2010|714|4.36%|\\n|2011|89|0%|\\n|2012| | |\\n|2013| | |\\n|2014| | |\\n|2015| | |\\n|2016| | |\\n|2017| | |\\n|2018| | |\\n|2019| | |\\n|2020| | |\\n|2021| | |\\n|2022| | |\\n|2023| | |\\n\\nFigure 8.2.1\\n\\nAttendance at NeurIPS Women in Machine Learning workshop (% of total), 2010–23\\n\\nSource: Women in Machine Learning, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n10%\\n8%\\n6%\\n4%\\n4.36%\\n2%\\n0%\\n\\nFigure 8.2.2\\n\\n5 Figure 8.1.1 accounts for total attendance, which in some conference years comprised both in-person and virtual attendance.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nChapter 8 Preview\\n\\n429\\n---\\n## Chapter 8: Diversity\\n\\nThe data in the subsequent figures is derived from a survey completed by participants who agreed to aggregate their information.

Understanding this public opinion is vital in better anticipating AI’s societal impacts and how the integration of the technology may differ across countries and demographic groups.\\n\\nThis chapter examines public opinion on AI through global, national, demographic, and ethnic perspectives. It draws upon several data sources: longitudinal survey data from Ipsos profiling global AI attitudes over time, survey data from the University of Toronto exploring public perception of ChatGPT, and data from Pew examining American attitudes regarding AI. The chapter concludes by analyzing mentions of significant AI models on Twitter, using data from Quid.\\n\\n437\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n### CHAPTER 9: Index Report 2024\\n\\n### Public Opinion\\n\\n### Chapter Highlights\\n\\n1. People across the globe are more cognizant of AI’s potential impact—and more nervous. A survey from Ipsos shows that, over the last year, the proportion of those who think AI will dramatically affect their lives in the next three to five years has increased from 60% to 66%. Moreover, 52% express nervousness toward AI products and services, marking a 13 percentage point rise from 2022. In America, Pew data suggests that 52% of Americans report feeling more concerned than excited about AI, rising from 38% in 2022.\\n\\n2. AI sentiment in Western nations continues to be low, but is slowly improving. In 2022, several developed Western nations, including Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Canada, and the United States, were among the least positive about AI products and services. Since then, each of these countries has seen a rise in the proportion of respondents acknowledging the benefits of AI, with the Netherlands experiencing the most significant shift.\\n\\n3. The public is pessimistic about AI’s economic impact. In an Ipsos survey, only 37% of respondents feel AI will improve their job. Only 34% anticipate AI will boost the economy, and 32% believe it will enhance the job market.\\n\\n4. Demographic differences emerge regarding AI optimism. Significant demographic differences exist in perceptions of AI’s potential to enhance livelihoods, with younger generations generally more optimistic. For instance, 59% of Gen Z respondents believe AI will improve entertainment options, versus only 40% of baby boomers. Additionally, individuals with higher incomes and education levels are more optimistic about AI’s positive impacts on entertainment, health, and the economy than their lower-income and less-educated counterparts.\\n\\n5. ChatGPT is widely known and widely used. An international survey from the University of Toronto suggests that 63% of respondents are aware of ChatGPT. Of those aware, around half report using ChatGPT at least once weekly.\\n---\\n## Chapter 9: Public Opinion\\n\\n### 9.1 Survey Data\\n\\nThis section explores global differences in AI opinions through surveys conducted by Ipsos in 2022 and 2023.

In contrast, only 37% of Americans agree with this perspective. Among the 31 countries surveyed, the United States and France exhibited the most skepticism.\\n\\nAttitudes toward AI are becoming more positive in countries that were previously critical. In 2022, several developed Western nations, including Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Canada, and the United States, were among the least positive about AI products and services. Since then, each of these countries has seen a rise in the proportion of respondents acknowledging the benefits of AI, with the Netherlands experiencing the most significant shift. By 2023, 43% of Dutch respondents viewed AI products and services positively, up from 33% the previous year.\\n---\\n## Chapter 9: Public Opinion\\n\\n|Country|% 2022|% 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Indonesia|78%|78%|\\n|Thailand|74%|74%|\\n|Mexico|65%|73%|\\n|Malaysia|65%|69%|\\n|Peru|67%|70%|\\n|Turkey|60%|67%|\\n|South Korea|62%|60%|\\n|India|65%|66%|\\n|Colombia|65%|65%|\\n|Singapore|64%|65%|\\n|Brazil|57%|64%|\\n|Romania|61%| |\\n|Chile|59%|61%|\\n|Argentina|55%|57%|\\n|Italy|50%|55%|\\n|Japan|42%|52%|\\n|Spain|53%| |\\n|Hungary|48%| |\\n|Poland|42%|49%|\\n|Great Britain|38%|53%|\\n|New Zealand|44%|48%|\\n|Netherlands|33%|49%|\\n|Germany|37%|48%|\\n|Ireland|40%| |\\n|Australia|37%|44%|\\n|Sweden|39%|43%|\\n|Belgium|39%| |\\n|Canada|32%|40%|\\n|United States|35%|40%|\\n|France|31%|37%|\\n\\nFigure 9.1.2: % of respondents that \"Agree\"\\n---\\n|Country|Opinions about AI by country (% agreeing with statement), 2023|\\n|---|---|\\n|Argentina|84% 59% 70% 73% 61% 73% 77% 78% 67% 76% 67% 78% 73% 67%|\\n|Australia|79% 62% 71% 58% 56% 69% 63% 61% 64% 58% 71% 53% 75% 71% 69%|\\n|Belgium|75% 52% 67% 61% 54% 77% 65% 63% 65% 53% 76% 65% 78% 82% 77%|\\n|Brazil|67% 70% 51% 64% 70% 67% 78% 70% 82% 61% 79% 81% 57%|\\n|Canada|59% 54% 66% 73% 62% 78% 72% 68% 73% 69% 74% 67% 74% 67%|\\n|Chile|70% 71% 44% 67% 73% 61% 73% 72% 67% 76% 73% 67% 67% 78%|\\n|Colombia|73% 67% 60% 78% 69% 65% 67% 55% 78% 63% 38%|\\n|France|58% 51% 61% 67% 77% 59% 78% 83% 37%|\\n|Germany|56% 66% 64% 78% 71% 43% 76% 63% 39%|\\n|Great Britain|74% 44% 73% 46% 62% 50% 75% 67% 36%|\\n|Hungary|59% 60% 64% 58% 65% 39% 69% 65% 36%|\\n|India|70% 61% 84% 73% 53% 67% 75% 43% 71% 65% 62% 78% 71% 77%|\\n|Indonesia|64% 62% 79% 67% 53% 81% 57%|\\n|Ireland|52% 54% 65% 78% 71% 63% 76% 59% 73% 78% 70% 82% 61% 55%|\\n|Italy|61% 44% 66% 76% 59% 63% 83% 38%|\\n|Japan|41% 37% 47% 47% 42% 45% 72% 59% 63% 38%|\\n|Malaysia|39% 37% 46% 48% 43% 44% 74% 67% 37%|\\n|Mexico|35% 36% 43% 42% 42% 43% 72% 50% 36%|\\n|Netherlands|39% 37% 45% 46% 44% 43% 73% 65% 36%|\\n|New Zealand|39% 37% 45% 46% 44% 43% 73% 65% 36%|\\n|Peru|69% 52% 65% 50% 63% 38% 63% 57% 63%|\\n|Poland|50% 52% 46% 65% 48% 50% 57% 54% 35%|\\n|Romania|38% 37% 43% 37% 42% 35% 71% 71% 35%|\\n|Singapore|41% 32% 42% 42% 47% 42% 72% 57% 32%|\\n|South Africa|41% 32% 44% 42% 47% 42% 72% 57% 32%|\\n|South Korea|31% 32% 33% 34% 36% 35% 72% 63% 34%|\\n|Spain|31% 32% 33% 34% 36% 35% 72% 63% 34%|\\n---\\n## Chapter 9: Public Opinion\\n\\nA large majority of the countries surveyed by Ipsos in 2022 were surveyed again in 2023, enabling cross-year comparisons. Figure 9.1.4 highlights the year-over-year percentage point change in answers to particular AI-related questions.

They received 11,000 responses to their most recent 2023 survey.\\n\\nFigure 9.1.12 shows that over the last year, Americans have grown increasingly concerned about the use of AI in their daily lives. In 2021 and 2022, only 37% and 38% of Americans, respectively, reported feeling more concerned than excited about AI technology. By 2023, this figure had risen to 52%, indicating that a majority of Americans now feel more concerned than excited about AI technology.\\n\\nPew also surveyed Americans’ opinions on whether they believed AI helped or hindered in specific contexts (Figure 9.1.13). Respondents reported that AI was more likely to be beneficial, particularly in assisting people to find products or services online, with 49% expressing this view. However, 53% of respondents indicated that AI was more likely to be detrimental than beneficial in safeguarding personal information privacy.\\n\\n| |Helps more than it hurts|Not sure|Hurts more than it helps|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|People finding products, services they are interested in online|49%|35%|15%|\\n|Doctors providing quality care to patients|37%|42%|20%|\\n|Companies making safe cars and trucks|37%|44%|19%|\\n|People finding accurate information online|33%|40%|27%|\\n|People taking care of their health|33%|47%|19%|\\n|Companies providing quality customer service|28%|37%|34%|\\n|Police maintaining public safety|24%|49%|26%|\\n|People keeping their personal information private|10%|37%|53%|\\n\\nTable of Contents Chapter 9 Preview 452\\n---\\n## Chapter 9: Public Opinion\\n\\n### 9.1 Survey Data\\n\\nPew further segmented the data by education level degrees are more likely to report that AI can significantly aid doctors in delivering quality care to patients and assist people in discovering products and services online that interest them.\\n\\n| |People finding products and services they are interested in online|Police maintaining public safety|People keeping their personal information private|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|College degree+|60%|27%|27%|\\n|Some college or less|44%|39%|17%|\\n| | | | |\\n| |Companies making safe cars and trucks|Doctors providing quality care to patients|People taking care of their health|\\n|College degree+|45%|40%|15%|\\n|Some college or less|33%|46%|20%|\\n| | | | |\\n| |People finding accurate information online|Companies providing quality customer service| |\\n|College degree+|36%|36%|28%|\\n|Some college or less|31%|42%|26%|\\n\\n% of respondents\\n\\nSource: Pew Research, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n---\\n## Chapter 9: Public Opinion\\n\\n9.2 Social Media Data\\n\\nDominant Models\\n\\nPublic attitudes toward AI can be assessed through both quantitative and qualitative analyses of posts made on social media. Quid analyzed social conversations surrounding AI models across various sectors from January to December 2023, examining over 7 million social media posts.\\n\\nFigure 9.2.1 shows the net sentiment score of various AI models released throughout the year. The net sentiment score expresses the ratio of positive to negative sentiment around a given topic. A net sentiment score of +100 means that all conversation is positive; a score of -100 means that all conversation is negative. Many models released in 2023 received positive social media sentiment. Some of the models that garnered the highest degree of positive attention were GraphCast, a new AI-powered weather forecasting system from DeepMind, and Claude 2.1, one of Anthropic’s most recent LLMs.\\n\\nNet sentiment score of AI models by quarter, 2023\\n\\nSource: Quid, 2023 | Chart: 2024 AI Index report\\n\\n| |2023/Q1|2023/Q2|2023/Q3|2023/Q4|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Stable Di�usion|40|37|53|45|\\n|Copilot|56|66|73|67|\\n|GPT-4|42|48|51|44|\\n|PaLM 2|NaN|62|66|75|\\n|DALL-E 3|NaN|NaN|74|72|\\n|Mistral 7B|NaN|NaN|92|56|\\n|Grok|NaN|NaN|NaN|57|\\n|GPT-4 Turbo|NaN|NaN|NaN|68|\\n|Whisper V3|NaN|NaN|NaN|83|\\n|GraphCast|NaN|NaN|NaN|94|\\n|Claude 2.1|NaN|NaN|NaN|87|\\n|Stable Video Di�usion|NaN|NaN|NaN|66|\\n|Orca 2|NaN|NaN|NaN|83|\\n|In�ection-2|NaN|NaN|NaN|81|\\n|Gemini|NaN|NaN|NaN|36|\\n|Midjourney v6|NaN|NaN|NaN|71|\\n\\nTable of Contents | Chapter 9 Preview\\n\\n454\\n---\\n## Chapter 9: Public Opinion\\n\\nFigure 9.2.2 highlights the proportion of AI-related social media conversation that was dominated by the release of particular models.

GPT-4 gathered most of the discussion volume in Q2 after its launch on March 14, 2023. Positive sentiment was primarily driven by its improvements, including faster processing speed, improved accuracy, and praise for its ability to enhance productivity across different types of work tasks, such as coding, corporate collaboration, and content creation. Negative sentiment primarily stemmed from complaints about occasional crashes of the ChatGPT website, along with an open letter led by Elon Musk and supported by over 1,300 artificial intelligence experts, urging AI laboratories to pause training of powerful AI systems. Moreover, there was disagreement regarding the “open letter” and the suggestion to halt AI research, particularly considering its potential to have a positive impact across multiple fields. For example, Andrew Ng posted:\\n\\n“1/The call for a 6 month moratorium on making AI progress beyond GPT-4 is a terrible idea. I’m seeing many new applications in education, healthcare, food, ... that’ll help many people. Improving GPT-4 will help. Lets balance the huge value AI is creating vs. realistic risks.” — @AndrewYNg\\n\\nIn Q4 2023, discussions surrounding the release of GPT-4 Turbo, launched in November, saw a significant increase. Positive sentiment centered around its innovative features and upgrades that could transform programmers’ workflows. These enhancements included longer conversation capabilities, improved contextual understanding, and multimodal ability to generate images. However, some negative feedback arose due to disappointment with the model’s knowledge cutoff in April 2023 and slower loading speeds compared to GPT-4. Some of the sample social media posts from this time included:\\n\\n- “This is just insane… My GPT-4 coding assistant can now: - build and design a frontend - create a backend with working db - correctly hook them up - upload code to GitHub - deploy it to Vercel[.] I can now build *complete* apps with nothing more than my voice. The future is here!” — @mckaywrigley\\n- “Trying to make my LinkedIn profile more interesting if a recruiter is using a large language model like GPT-4 to send me a message. Looks like it works on the public version of my profile!” — @brdskggs\\n- “GPT-4 Turbo has knowledge of the world up to April 2023. @sama says the team is ‘just as annoyed as you, maybe more’ that the knowledge is not more updated and that @openai will work to make sure it never gets that outdated again.” — @VentureBeat\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Chapter 9: Public Opinion\\n\\n### Index Report 2024\\n\\n### 9.2 Social Media Data\\n\\nHighlight:\\n\\nAI-Related Social Media Discussion in 2023 (cont’d)\\n\\nDiscussions about Stable Diffusion were more prominent in the first half of 2023, but decreased toward the year’s end. More posts mentioned Stable Diffusion XL models than Stable Diffusion 2.0 (around 16 times more). Positive sentiment was mainly driven by the tool’s rapid increase in popularity, the potential benefits of AI in enhancing creativity, and the excitement surrounding technical advancements and improvements (e.g., enhanced accuracy, better understanding of various concepts, and higher resolution). On the other hand, negative sentiment revolved around concerns about legal and ethical issues related to AI-generated content, such as copyright violations, ownership of AI-created material, and the possible replacement of human artists by AI. Additionally, worries were expressed about the risks and threats linked to artificial intelligence, like its potential harmful effects, the spread of misinformation, and the possibility of AI being used for academic cheating.\\n\\nBoth Gemini (from Google) and Grok (from xAI) saw an increase in conversations during Q4 due to their late year launches. Positive feedback for Gemini focused on its improved accuracy and multilingual capabilities, as well as its potential to enhance various Google services like Search and Ads. On the other hand, negative opinions stemmed from concerns about inaccurate results, disappointment over Gemini’s delayed release, and skepticism toward the Gemini AI demo.\\n\\n“WHAT IS GOOGLE GEMINI AND HOW CAN YOU USE IT?” — Erik Hyrkas\\n\\n“Gemini Ultra (if Google is honest) Will Blow Our Minds” — Tina Huang\\n\\n“Very happy about sharing smashed Stable Diffusion models! - In one line of code, we compressed popular text-to-image Stable Diffusion models for A100. - Evaluations across various metrics show significant speedup improvements, energy savings, and CO2 emissions savings. Now looking forward [to] sharing more compression results :) Feel free to contact us to achieve the same on your own models https://pruna.ai/contact ;)” — @Bertrand_Charp\\n---\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nIndex Report 2024        Appendix\\n---\\n# Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 Appendix\\n\\n|Chapter 1|Research and Development|460|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Chapter 2|Technical Performance|465|\\n|Chapter 3|Responsible AI|472|\\n|Chapter 4|Economy|478|\\n|Chapter 5|Science and Medicine|488|\\n|Chapter 6|Education|491|\\n|Chapter 7|Policy and Governance|495|\\n|Chapter 8|Diversity|500|\\n|Chapter 9|Public Opinion|501|\\n\\nTable of Contents 459-459\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024\\n\\n### Chapter 1: Research and Development\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nThe AI Index would like to acknowledge Ben Cottier and Robi Rahman from Epoch for leading the work analyzing machine learning training costs; Robi Rahman for leading work regarding the national affiliation of notable systems; and James da Costa, for doing coding work instrumental to the sectoral and national affiliation analysis of foundation models.\\n\\nAI Conference Attendance\\n\\nThe AI Index reached out to the organizers of various AI conferences in 2023 and asked them to provide information on total attendance.

CSET also provided publication counts and year-by-year citations for AI-relevant work associated with each country. A publication is associated with a country if it has at least one author whose organizational affiliation(s) is located in that country. If there is no observed country, the publication receives an \"Unknown/Missing\" country label. Citation counts aren’t available for all publications; those without counts weren’t included in the citation analysis. Over 70% of English-language AI papers published between 2010 and 2022 have citation data available.\\n\\nAdditionally, publication counts by year and by country were provided.\\n\\n### Patents From CSET’s AI and Robotics Patents Dataset\\n\\n#### Source\\n\\nCSET’s AI patents dataset was developed by CSET and 1790 Analytics and includes data from The Lens, 1790 Analytics, and EPO’s PATSTAT. Patents relevant to the development and application of AI and robotics were identified by their CPC/IPC codes and keywords.\\n\\n#### Methodology\\n\\nIn this analysis, patents were grouped by year and country, and then counted at the \"patent family\" level.\\n\\nThese scores are based on cosine similarities between field-of-study and paper embeddings. See Autumn Toney and James Dunham, “Multi-Label Classification of Scientific Research Documents Across Domains and Languages,” Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing (Association for Computational Linguistics, 2022): 105–14, https://aclanthology.org/2022.sdp-1.12/.\\n\\nSee https://ror.org/ for more information about the ROR dataset.\\n\\nPatents are analyzed at the \"patent family\" level rather than \"patent document\" level because patent families are a collective of patent documents all associated with a single invention and/or innovation by the same inventors/assignees. Thus, counting at the \"patent family\" level mitigates artificial number inflation when there are multiple patent documents in a patent family or if a patent is filed in multiple jurisdictions.\\n\\n|Table of Contents|Appendix|\\n|---|---|\\n| |461|\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Appendix\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## Chapter 1: Research and Development\\n\\nlevel.7 CSET extracted year values from the first publication date within a family. Countries are assigned to patents based on the country or filing office where a patent is first filed (e.g., if a patent is filed with the USPTO on January 1, 2020, and then with the German Patenting Office on January 2, 2020, the patent is classified as a patent with U.S. inventors).\\n\\nNote that the same patent may have multiple countries (but not years) attributed to it if the inventors filed their patent in multiple countries on the same first filing date (e.g., if a patent is filed with the USPTO on January 1, 2020, and then with the German Patenting Office on January 1, 2020, the patent is classified as a patent with U.S. inventors and as a patent with German inventors).\\n\\nNote that patents filed with supranational organizations, such as patents filed under WIPO (the World Intellectual Property Organization), EP (European Patent Organization), and EA (a special area of Spain not included in the European Union), also fall under the “Rest of World” category.\\n\\n### Ecosystems Graph Analysis\\n\\nTo track the distribution of AI foundation models by country, the AI Index team took the following steps:\\n\\n1. A snapshot of the Ecosystems Graph was taken in early January 2024.\\n2. Authors of foundation models are attributed to countries based on their affiliation credited on the paper/technical documentation associated with the model. For international organizations, authors are attributed to the country where the organization is headquartered, unless a more specific location is indicated.\\n\\nIn CSET’s data analysis for the 2022 AI Index, the most recent publication date for a patent family was used. This method has the advantage of capturing updates within a patent family (such as amendments). However, to remain consistent with CSET’s other data products, including the Country Activity Tracker, the first filing year was used instead in this data analysis.\\n\\n### Epoch Notable Models Analysis\\n\\nThe AI forecasting research group Epoch maintains a dataset of landmark AI and ML models, along with accompanying information about their creators and publications, such as the list of their (co)authors, number of citations, type of AI task accomplished, and amount of compute used in training.\\n\\nThe nationalities of the authors of these papers have important implications for geopolitical AI forecasting. As various research institutions and technology companies start producing advanced ML models, the global distribution of future AI development may shift or concentrate in certain places, which in turn affects the geopolitical landscape because AI is expected to become a crucial component of economic and military power in the near future.\\n\\nTo track the distribution of AI research contributions on landmark publications by country, the Epoch dataset is coded according to a specific methodology.\\n\\n### Table of Contents\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\n462\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024\\n\\n### Chapter 1: Research and Development\\n\\n1. A snapshot of the dataset was taken on January 1, 2024. This includes papers about landmark models, selected using the inclusion criteria of importance, relevance, and uniqueness, as described in the Compute Trends dataset documentation.\\n\\n2. The authors are attributed to countries based on their affiliation credited on the paper. For international organizations, authors are attributed to the country where the organization is headquartered, unless a more specific location is indicated.\\n\\n3. All of the landmark publications are aggregated within time periods (e.g., monthly or yearly) with the national contributions added up to determine what each country’s contribution to landmark AI research was during each time period.\\n\\n4. The contributions of different countries are compared over time to identify any trends.\\n\\n### Mapping AI Projects to Geographic Areas\\n\\nPublic AI projects are mapped to geographic areas using IP address geolocation to determine the mode location of a project’s owners each year. Each project owner is assigned a location based on their IP address when interacting with GitHub. If a project owner changes locations within a year, the location for the project would be determined by the mode location of its owners sampled daily in the year. Additionally, the last known location of the project owner is carried forward on a daily basis even if no activities were performed by the project owner that day. For example, if a project owner performed activities within the United States and then became inactive for six days, that project owner would be considered to be in the United States for that seven-day span.\\n\\n### Training Cost Analysis\\n\\nTo create the dataset of cost estimates, the Epoch database was filtered for models released during the large-scale ML era that were above the median of training compute in a two-year window centered on their release date. This filtered for the largest-scale ML models. There were 138 qualifying systems based on these criteria. Of these systems, 48 had sufficient information to estimate the training cost.\\n\\nFor the selected ML models, the training time and the type, quantity, and utilization rate of the training hardware were determined from the publication, press release, or technical reports, as applicable. Cloud rental prices for the computing hardware used by these models were collected from online historical archives of cloud vendors’ websites.\\n\\n### Identifying AI Projects\\n\\nIn partnership with researchers from Harvard Business School, Microsoft Research, and Microsoft’s AI for Good Lab, GitHub identifies public AI repositories following the methodologies of Gonzalez, Zimmerman, and Nagappan, 2020, and Dohmke, Iansiti, and Richards, 2023, using topic labels related to AI/ML and generative AI, respectively, along with the topics “machine learning,” “deep learning,” or “artificial intelligence.” GitHub further augments the dataset with repositories that have a dependency on the PyTorch, TensorFlow, or OpenAI libraries for Python.\\n\\n9 The selected cutoff date was September 1, 2015, in accordance with Compute Trends Across Three Eras of Machine Learning (Epoch, 2022).\\n\\n10 Historic prices were collected from archived snapshots of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform price catalogs viewed through the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.\\n\\n**Table of Contents**\\n|Appendix|463|\\n|---|---|\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Appendix\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## Chapter 1: Research and Development\\n\\nTraining costs were estimated from the hardware type, quantity, and time by multiplying the hourly cloud rental cost rates (at the time of training) by the quantity of hardware hours. This yielded the cost to train each model using the same hardware used by the authors to train the same model at the time. However, some developers purchased hardware rather than renting cloud computers, so the true costs incurred by the developers may vary.\\n\\nVarious challenges were encountered while estimating the training cost of these models. Often, the developers did not disclose the duration of training or the hardware that was used. In other cases, cloud compute pricing was not available for the hardware. The investigation of training cost trends is continued in a forthcoming Epoch report, including an expanded dataset with more models and hardware prices.\\n\\nThe chosen rental cost rate was the most recent published price for the hardware and cloud vendor used by the developer of the model, at a three-year commitment rental rate, after subtracting the training duration and two months from the publication date. If this price was not available, the most analogous price was used: the same hardware and vendor at a different date, otherwise the same hardware from a different cloud vendor. If a three-year commitment rental rate was unavailable, this was imputed from other rental rates based on the empirical average discount for the given cloud vendor. If the exact hardware type was not available, e.g., “NVIDIA A100 SXM4 40GB,” then a generalization was used, e.g., “NVIDIA A100.”\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nAppendix\\n464\\n---\\n## Artificial IntelligenceArtificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Appendix\\n\\n## Index Report 2024Index Report 2024\\n\\n## Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\nChapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nThe AI Index would like to acknowledge Andrew Shi for his work doing a literature review on the environmental impact of AI models; Emily Capstick for her work studying the use of RLHF in machine learning models; Sukrut Oak for his work generating sample Midjourney generations; and Emma Williamson for her work identifying significant AI technical advancements for the timeline.\\n\\n### Benchmarks\\n\\n|1.

The AI Index also acknowledges that the Global State of Responsible AI analysis was done in collaboration with Accenture. The AI Index specifically wants to highlight the contributions of Arnab Chakraborty, Patrick Connolly, Jakub Wiatrak, Ray Eitel-Porter, Dikshita Venkatesh, and Shekhar Tewari to the data collection and analysis.\\n\\nThe keywords searched include:\\n\\n- Fairness and bias: algorithmic fairness, bias detection, bias mitigation, discrimination, equity in AI, ethical algorithm design, fair data practices, fair ML, fairness and bias, group fairness, individual fairness, justice, non-discrimination, representational fairness, unfair, unfairness.\\n- Privacy and data governance: anonymity, confidentiality, data breach, data ethics, data governance, data integrity, data privacy, data protection, data transparency, differential privacy, inference privacy, machine unlearning, privacy by design, privacy-preserving, secure data storage, trustworthy data curation.\\n\\nConference Submissions Analysis\\n\\nFor the analysis on responsible AI-related conference submissions, the AI Index examined the number of responsible AI–related academic submissions at the following conferences: AAAI, AIES, FAccT, ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS. Specifically, the team scraped the conference websites or repositories of conference submissions for papers containing relevant keywords indicating they could fall into a particular responsible AI category. The papers were then manually verified by a human team to confirm their categorization. It is possible that a single paper could belong to multiple responsible AI categories.\\n\\nSecurity: adversarial attack, adversarial learning, AI incident, attacks, audits, cybersecurity, ethical hacking, forensic analysis, fraud detection, red teaming, safety, security, security ethics, threat detection, vulnerability assessment.\\n\\nTransparency and explainability: algorithmic transparency, audit, auditing, causal reasoning, causality, explainability, explainable AI, explainable models, human-understandable decisions, interpretability, interpretable models, model explainability, outcome explanation, transparency, xAI.\\n\\n|Table of Contents|Appendix|\\n|---|---|\\n|472|472|\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024\\n\\n### Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\nConsistency of Responsible AI Benchmark Reporting\\n\\nFor each of the analyzed models (GPT-4, Gemini, Claude 2, Llama 2, Mistral 7B), the AI Index reviewed the official papers published by the model developers at the time of model release for reported academic benchmarks. The AI Index did not consider subsequent benchmark reports by the model developers or external parties. The AI Index also did not include benchmarks on academic or professional exams (e.g., the GRE), benchmarks for modalities other than text, or internal evaluation metrics.\\n\\nGlobal Responsible State of AI Survey\\n\\nResearchers from Stanford conducted a global responsible AI (RAI) survey in collaboration with Accenture. The objective of the questionnaire was to gain an understanding of the current level of RAI adoption globally and allow for a comparison of RAI activities across 19 industries and 22 countries. The survey is further used to develop an early snapshot of current perceptions around the responsible development, deployment, and use of generative AI and how this might affect RAI adoption and mitigation techniques. The survey covers a total of 10 RAI dimensions: Reliability; Privacy and Data Governance; Fairness and Nondiscrimination; Transparency and Explainability; Human Interaction; Societal and Environmental Well-Being; Accountability; Leadership/Principles/Culture; Lawfulness and Compliance; and Organizational Governance. Only some of the survey findings are presented in the AI Index, with a more detailed report, the Global State of Responsible AI Report, coming out in May/June 2024.\\n\\nBelow is the full list of measures respondents were asked about in the survey and which were referenced in the AI Index subchapters. The organizations could answer on a scale from Not applied, Ad-hoc, Rolling out, or Fully operationalized. The companies were further given the option to select Other and provide information on mitigation measures not listed.\\n\\nFairness measures:\\n\\n- Collection of representative data based on the anticipated user demographics\\n- Making methodology and data sources accessible to third parties (auditors/general public) for independent oversight\\n- Involvement of diverse stakeholders in model development and/or review process\\n- Assessment of performance across different demographic groups\\n- Use of technical bias mitigation techniques during model development\\n- Other (selection of this option opened an optional free-text field)\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\n473\\n---\\n## Appendix\\n\\n### Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\n### Data governance measures:\\n\\nChecks to ensure pat pe data complies wip all relevant laws and regulations and is used wip consent, where applicable\\nData collection and preparation include assessment of pe completeness, uniqueness, consistency, and accuracy of pe data\\nChecks to ensure pat pe data is representative wip respect to pe demographic setting wipin which pe final model/system is used\\nRegular data audits and updates to ensure pe relevancy of pe data\\nProcess for dataset documentation and traceability proughout pe AI life cycle\\nRemediation plans for and documentation of datasets wip shortcomings\\nOper (selection of pis option opened an optional free-text field)\\n\\n### Transparency and explainability:\\n\\nDocumentation of pe development process, detailing algoripm design choices, data sources, intended use cases, and limitations\\nTraining programs for stakeholders (incl. users) covering pe intended use cases and limitations of pe model\\nPrioritization of simpler models where high interpretability is crucial, even if it sacrifices some performance\\nUse model explainability tools (e.g., saliency maps) to elucidate model decisions\\nOper (selection of pis option opened an optional free-text field)\\n\\n### Reliability measures:\\n\\nMitigation measures for model errors and handling low confidence outputs\\nFailover plans or oper measures to ensure pe system’s/model’s availability\\nEvaluation of models/systems for vulnerabilities or harmful behavior (i.e., red teaming)\\nMeasures to prevent adversarial attacks\\nConfidence scoring for model outputs\\nComprehensive test cases pat cover a wide range of scenarios and metrics\\nOper (selection of pis option opened an optional free-text field)\\n\\n### Security measures:\\n\\nBasic cybersecurity hygiene practices (e.g., multifactor aupentication, access controls, and employee training)\\nVetting and validation of cybersecurity measures of pird parties in pe supply chain\\nDedicated AI cybersecurity team and/or personnel explicitly trained for AI-specific cybersecurity\\nTechnical AI-specific cybersecurity checks and measures, e.g., adversarial testing, vulnerability assessments, and data security measures\\nResources dedicated to research and monitoring of evolving AI-specific cybersecurity risks and integration in existing cybersecurity processes\\nOper (selection of pis option opened an optional free-text field)\\n\\n### Table of Contents\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\n474\\n---\\n## Works Cited\\n\\nAgarwal, A. & Agarwal, H.

Job postings are useful for understanding trends in the labor market because they allow for a detailed, real-time look at the skills employers seek. To assess the representativeness of job postings data, Lightcast conducts a number of analyses to compare the distribution of job postings to the distribution of official government and other third-party sources in the United States. The primary source of government data on U.S. job postings is the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) program, conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Based on comparisons between JOLTS and Lightcast, the labor market demand captured by Lightcast data represents over 99% of the total labor demand. Jobs not posted online are usually in small businesses (the classic example being the “Help Wanted” sign in the restaurant window) and union hiring halls.\\n\\nMeasuring Demand for AI In order to measure the demand by employers of AI skills, Lightcast uses its skills taxonomy of over 30,000 skills. The list of AI skills from Lightcast data are shown below, with associated skill clusters. While some skills are considered to be in the AI cluster specifically, for the purposes of this report, all skills below were considered AI skills. A job posting was considered an AI job if it mentioned any of these skills in the job text.\\n\\nData presented in the Robot Installations section was sourced from the “World Robotics 2023” report.\\n\\nLightcast Prepared by Cal McKeever, Julia Nitschke, and Layla O’Kane Lightcast delivers job market analytics that empower employers, workers, and educators to make data-driven decisions. The company’s artificial intelligence technology analyzes hundreds of millions of job postings and real-life career transitions to provide insight into labor market patterns. This real-time strategic intelligence offers crucial insights, such as what jobs are most in demand, the specific skills employers need, and the career directions that offer the highest potential for workers.

India, despite not reaching 40% coverage, was included in this sample because of its increasing importance in the global economy.\\n\\nSkills (AI Engineering and AI Literacy skills)\\n\\nLinkedIn members self-report their skills on their LinkedIn profiles. Currently, more than 41,000 distinct, standardized skills are identified by LinkedIn. These have been coded and classified by taxonomists at LinkedIn into 249 skill groupings, which are the skill groups represented in the dataset.\\n\\nSkill groupings are derived by expert taxonomists through a similarity-index methodology that measures skill composition at the industry level. LinkedIn’s industry taxonomy and their corresponding NAICS codes can be found here.\\n\\nThis year LinkedIn made updates to the AI skills list and categorized them into “AI Engineering” and “AI Literacy” skills. See “AI Skills List Update Compared to Last Year” section for more details.\\n\\nSkills Genome\\n\\nFor any entity (occupation or job, country, sector, etc.), the skill genome is an ordered list (a vector) of the 50 “most characteristic skills” of that entity. These most characteristic skills are identified using a TF-IDF algorithm to identify the most representative skills of the target entity, while down-ranking ubiquitous skills that add little information about that specific entity (e.g., Microsoft Word).\\n---\\n## Appendix\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## Chapter 4: Economy\\n\\nTF-IDF is a statistical measure that evaluates how representative a word (in this case, a skill) is to a selected entity. This is done by multiplying two metrics:\\n\\n- The term frequency of a skill in an entity (“TF”).\\n- The logarithmic inverse entity frequency of the skill across a set of entities (“IDF”). This indicates how common or rare a word is in the entire entity set. The closer IDF is to 0, the more common a word is.\\n\\nSo, if the skill is very common across LinkedIn entities, and appears in many job or member descriptions, the IDF will approach 0. If, on the other hand, the skill is unique to specific entities, the IDF will approach 1.\\n\\nDetails are available at LinkedIn’s Skills Genome and LinkedIn–World Bank Methodology note.\\n\\n### AI Skills Penetration\\n\\nThe aim of this indicator is to measure the intensity of AI skills in an entity (in a particular country, industry, gender, etc.) through the following methodology:\\n\\n- Compute frequencies for all self-added skills by LinkedIn members in a given entity (occupation, industry, etc.) in 2015–2023.\\n- Re-weight skill frequencies using a TF-IDF model to get the top 50 most representative skills in that entity. These 50 skills compose the “skill genome” of that entity.\\n- Compute the share of skills that belong to the AI skill group out of the top skills in the selected entity.\\n\\nInterpretation: The AI skill penetration rate signals the prevalence of AI skills across occupations, or the intensity with which LinkedIn members utilize AI skills in their jobs. For example, the top 50 skills for the occupation of engineer are calculated based on the weighted frequency with which they appear in LinkedIn.\\n\\n### Jobs or Occupations\\n\\nLinkedIn member titles are standardized and grouped into approximately 15,000 occupations. These are not sector- or country-specific. These occupations are further standardized into approximately 3,600 occupation representatives. Occupation representatives group occupations with a common role and specialty, regardless of seniority.\\n\\n### AI Jobs or Occupations\\n\\nAn “AI” job is an occupation representative that requires AI skills to perform the job. Skills penetrations are used as a signal for whether AI skills are prevalent in an occupation representative, in any sector where the occupation representative may exist. Examples of such occupations include (but are not limited to): Machine Learning Engineer, Artificial Intelligence Specialist, Data Scientist, and Computer Vision Engineer.\\n\\n### AI Talent\\n\\nA LinkedIn member is considered AI talent if they have explicitly added AI skills to their profile and/or they are occupied in an AI occupation representative. The counts of AI talent are used to calculate talent concentration metrics. For example, to calculate the country-level AI talent concentration, we use the counts of AI talent at the country level vis-a-vis the counts of LinkedIn members in the respective countries. Note that concentration metrics may be influenced by LinkedIn coverage in these countries and should be utilized with caution.\\n\\n### Table of Contents\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\n481\\n---\\n## Appendix\\n\\n### Chapter 4: Economy\\n\\nRelative AI Skills Penetration\\n\\nTo allow for skills penetration comparisons across countries, the skills genomes are calculated and a relevant benchmark is selected (e.g., global average). A ratio is then constructed between a country’s and the benchmark’s AI skills penetrations, controlling for occupations.\\n\\nInterpretation: A country’s relative AI skills penetration of 1.5 indicates that AI skills are 1.5 times as frequent as in the benchmark, for an overlapping set of occupations.\\n\\nGlobal Comparison\\n\\nFor cross-country comparison, we present the relative penetration rate of AI skills, measured as the sum of the penetration of each AI skill across occupations in a given country, divided by the average global penetration of AI skills across the overlapping occupations in a sample of countries.\\n\\nInterpretation: A relative penetration rate of 2 means that the average penetration of AI skills in that country is two times the global average across the same set of occupations.\\n\\nGlobal Comparison: By Industry\\n\\nThe relative AI skills penetration by country for industry provides an in-depth sectoral decomposition of AI skill penetration across industries and sample countries.\\n\\nInterpretation: A country’s relative AI skill penetration rate of 2 in the education sector means that the average penetration of AI skills in that country is two times the global average across the same set of occupations in that sector.\\n\\nGlobal Comparison: By Gender\\n\\nThe “Relative AI Skills Penetration by Gender” metric provides a cross-country comparison of AI skill penetrations within each gender, comparing countries’ male/female AI skill penetrations to the global average of the same gender.\\n\\nSince the global averages are distinct for each gender, this metric should only be used to compare country rankings within each gender, and not for cross-gender comparisons within countries.\\n\\nInterpretation: A country’s AI skills penetration for women of 1.5 means that female members in that country are 1.5 times more likely to list AI skills than the average female member in all countries pooled together across the same set of occupations that exist in the country/gender combination.\\n\\nGlobal Comparison: Across Genders\\n\\nThe “Relative AI Skills Penetration Across Genders” metric allows for cross-gender comparisons within and across countries globally, since we compare the countries’ male/female AI skill penetrations to the same global average regardless of gender.\\n\\nRelative AI Talent Hiring Rate YoY Ratio\\n\\n- LinkedIn Hiring Rate or Overall Hiring Rate is a measure of hires normalized by LinkedIn membership. It is computed as the percentage of LinkedIn members who added a new employer in the same period the job began, divided by the total number of LinkedIn members in the corresponding location.\\n- AI Hiring Rate is computed following the overall hiring rate methodology, but only considering members classified as AI talent.\\n- Relative AI Talent Hiring Rate YoY Ratio is the year-over-year change in AI Hiring Rate relative to Overall Hiring Rate in the same country. For each month, we first calculate AI Hiring rate in the country, then divide AI Hiring Rate by Overall Hiring Rate in that country.\\n\\n### Table of Contents\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\n482\\n---\\n## Artificial IntelligenceArtificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Appendix\\n\\n## Index Report 2024Index Report 2024\\n\\n## Chapter 4: Economy\\n\\nthen calculate YoY change of this ratio, and then take the 12-month moving average using the last 12 months.\\n\\nInterpretation: In 2023 in India, the ratio of AI talent hiring relative to overall hiring has grown 16.8% year over year.\\n\\n### AI Talent Migration\\n\\nData on migration comes from the World Bank Group–LinkedIn “Digital Data for Development” partnership (please see Zhu et al. [2018]).\\n\\nLinkedIn migration rates are derived from the self-identified locations of LinkedIn member profiles. For example, when a LinkedIn member updates his or her location from Paris to London, this is counted as a migration. Migration data is available from 2019 onward. LinkedIn data provides insights into countries on the AI Talent gained or lost due to migration trends.\\n\\nAI Talent migration is considered for all members with AI Skills/holding AI jobs at time t for country A as the country of interest and country B as the source of inflows and destination for outflows. Thus, net AI Talent migration between country A and country B—for country A—is calculated as follows:\\n\\nNet Al Talent Migration = Net Al Talent flows 4b - Member count\\n\\nNet flows are defined as total arrivals minus departures within the given time period. LinkedIn membership varies considerably between countries, which makes interpreting absolute movements of members from one country to another difficult. To compare migration flows between countries fairly, migration flows are normalized for the country of interest. For example, if country A is the country of interest, all absolute net flows into and out of country A, regardless of origin and destination countries, are normalized based on LinkedIn membership in country A at the end of each year and multiplied by 10,000. Hence, this metric indicates relative talent migration from all countries to and from country A.\\n\\n### AI Skills List Update Compared to Last Year\\n\\n1. LinkedIn introduced “AI Literacy” skills.\\n- The following skills were added to the list and categorized as “AI Literacy” skills: ChatGPT, DALL-E, GPT-3, GPT-4, Generative Art, Github Copilot, Google Bard, Midjourney, Prompt Engineering, and Stable Diffusion.\\n2. LinkedIn updated the former AI skills list and categorized them as “AI Engineering” skills:\\n- The following skills were excluded from the list: Alexa, Common Lisp, Data Structures, Gaussian 03, Graph Theory, IBM Watson, Information Retrieval, Jena, Julia (Programming Language), Linked Data, Lisp, Pandas (Software), Parallel Algorithms, Perl Automation, Resource Description Framework, Smalltalk, and dSPACE.\\n- The following skills were added to the list: Apache Spark ML, Applied Machine Learning, Audio Synthesis, Autoencoders, Automated Clustering, Automated Feature Engineering, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), Autoregressive Models, Chatbot Development, Chatbots, Concept Drift Adaptation, Conditional Generation, Conditional Image Generation, Decision Trees, Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Generative AI, Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Generative\\n\\n### Table of Contents\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\n483\\n---\\n## Appendix\\n\\n### Chapter 4: Economy\\n\\nDesign Optimization, Generative Flow Models, PostgreSQL database delivery, and so on.

Quid uses its own in-house LLM and other smart search features, as well as traditional Boolean query, to search for focus areas, topics, and keywords within many datasets: social media, news, forums and blogs, companies, patents, as well as other custom feeds of data (e.g., survey data). Quid has many visualization options and data delivery endpoints, including network graphs based on semantic similarity, in-platform dashboarding capabilities, as well as programmatic search features.\\n\\n### Data\\n\\nCompanies\\n\\nOrganization data is embedded from Capital IQ and Crunchbase. These companies include all types of organizations (private, public, operating, operating as a subsidiary, out of business) throughout the world. The investment data includes private investments, M&A, public offerings, minority stakes made by PE/VCs, corporate venture arms, governments, and institutions both within and outside the United States. Some data is simply unreachable—for instance, when investors’ names or funding amounts are undisclosed. Quid embeds Capital IQ data as a default and adds in data from Crunchbase for the data points.\\n\\n### Table of Contents\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\n484\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024\\n\\n### Chapter 4: Economy\\n\\nthat are not captured in Capital IQ. This not only yields comprehensive and accurate data on all global organizations, but it also captures early-stage startups and funding events data. Company information is updated on a weekly basis.\\n\\n### Earnings Calls\\n\\nQuid leverages earnings call transcript data embedded from Seeking Alpha. For this report, Quid has analyzed mentions of AI-related keywords across all earnings call transcripts from Fortune 500 companies from January 2018 through December 2023. New earnings call transcript data is updated in Quid on the 1st and 15th of every month.\\n\\n### Search Parameters\\n\\nBoolean query is used to search for focus areas, topics, and keywords within the archived company database, within their business descriptions and websites. We can filter out the search results by HQ regions, investment amount, operating status, organization type (private/public), and founding year. Quid then visualizes these companies by semantic similarity. If there are more than 7,000 companies from the search result, Quid selects the 7,000 most relevant companies for visualization based on the language algorithm.\\n\\nBoolean search: “artificial intelligence” or “AI” or “machine learning” or “deep learning”\\n\\n### Companies\\n\\nGlobal AI and ML companies pat have received investments (private, IPO, M&A) from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2023.\\nGlobal AI and ML companies pat have received over $1.5M for pe last 10 years (January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2023).\\nGlobal data was also pulled for a Generative AI query (Boolean search: “generative AI” OR “gen AI” OR “generative artificial intelligence”) for companies pat have received over $1.5M for pe last 10 years (January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2023).\\n\\n### Target Event Definitions\\n\\n- Private investments: A private placement is a private sale of newly issued securities (equity or debt) by a company to a selected investor or a selected group of investors. The stakes that buyers take in private placements are often minority stakes (under 50%), although it is possible to take control of a company through a private placement as well, in which case the private placement would be a majority stake investment.\\n- Minority investment: These refer to minority stake acquisitions in Quid, which take place when the buyer acquires less than 50% of the existing ownership stake in entities, asset products, and business divisions.\\n- M&A: This refers to a buyer acquiring more than 50% of the existing ownership stake in entities, asset products, and business divisions.\\n\\n### McKinsey & Company\\n\\nData used in the Corporate Activity–Industry Adoption section was sourced from the McKinsey Global Survey “The State of AI in 2023: Generative AI’s Breakout Year.”\\n\\nThe online survey was in the field April 11, 2023, to April 21, 2023, and garnered responses from 1,684 participants representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures.

To learn more about the methodology employed for the surveys, please visit the following links: March 2023 and July 2023.\\n\\nInformatics Europe collects statistics annually and publishes them on the Informatics Europe Higher Education Data Portal, which is updated with the most recent data at the end of the year (typically in December). The data is collected from countries where a solid and reasonably complete picture could be drawn from official sources such as national statistical offices, educational agencies, or ministries.\\n\\nThe full list of sources can be found in the Data Portal section \"Data Sources.\" The Data Portal follows the definitions and concepts provided by these national agencies and reflects the national situation in the countries considered. Those aspects that are not exposed by the consulted agencies are not part of the dataset. A full list of definitions and concepts used can be found in the footnotes shown at the bottom of the Statistics section.\\n\\nSince each national data repository has its own structure and quite often provides all supporting information in the national language, Informatics Europe consults with its members—academics, active and knowledgeable in the informatics field from respective countries—who help to interpret the statistics available and who understand the specificities of these countries’ higher education systems. One of the main challenges in integrating the statistical data is the identification of terms used to define the informatics discipline in different countries. Informatics is known under different names in different European languages and countries, and in English as well. A good dozen terms (presented in the Data Portal section \"Subjects\") are used to denote what is fundamentally the same discipline, and the role of national experts here is to help with screening the terms and programs and identifying which part of them is pertinent to the informatics field.\\n\\nThe data covers the degrees delivered by both traditional Research Universities (RU) and University of Applied Science (UAS) for the countries where these institutions also offer bachelor’s and master’s studies in informatics. The full list of institutions covered can be found in the Data Portal section \"Institutions & Academic Units.\"\\n\\n### Appendix\\n\\n492\\n---\\n## Appendix\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## Chapter 6: Education\\n\\nStudyportals categorizes the study programs on its portals into disciplines and subdisciplines. The 15 disciplines are broad categories of educational fields to help navigate the portals. The 284 subdisciplines are narrower topics, subdivisions, or specialized areas of disciplines. Paying clients can provide input, but ultimately, data processors manually choose the one-to-three closest fitting subdisciplines according to the following scenarios, listed in decreasing order of likelihood.\\n\\n1. Classic scenario: When the study name closely matches one subdiscipline name.\\n\\n- “Chemistry” -> subdiscipline Chemistry.\\n2. Classic interdisciplinary scenario: When the study name closely matches two or three subdiscipline names.\\n\\n- “International Fashion Management and Marketing” -> subdisciplines Fashion Management + Marketing.\\n3. Specializations scenario: When not all the subdisciplines are mentioned in the study name, but they are listed as specific specializations, concentrations, or tracks.\\n\\n- “Business Administration with specializations in Finance and International Business” -> subdisciplines Business Administration + Finance + International Business\\n4. Mixed scenario: When the study name does not closely match any specific subdiscipline but can be represented by combining two or three subdisciplines.\\n\\n- “Financial Economics” -> subdisciplines Finance + Economics\\n5.

Additionally, the Index would like to acknowledge the efforts of Ethan Duncan He-Li Hellman, Julia Betts Lotufo, Alexandra Rome, and Emma Williamson in collecting, coding, and analyzing AI-related legislation and regulations. The Index is also grateful for the guidance provided by Caroline Meinhardt on AI legislation and regulation tracking.\\n\\nGlobal AI Mentions\\n\\nFor mentions of AI in AI-related legislative proceedings around the world, the AI Index performed searches of the keyword “artificial intelligence” on the websites of 80 countries’ congresses or parliaments (in the respective languages), usually under sections named “minutes,” “hansard,” etc. In some cases, databases were only searchable by title, so site search functions were deployed. The AI Index team surveyed the following databases: Andorra, Angola, Armenia, Australia, Azerbaijan, Barbados, Belgium, Bermuda, Bhutan, Brazil, Cabo Verde, Canada, Cayman Islands, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, France, The Gambia, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Ireland, Isle of Man, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kosovo, Latvia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macao.\\n\\nThe National People’s Congress is held once per year and does not provide full legislative proceedings. Hence, the counts included in the analysis only searched mentions of “artificial intelligence” in the only public document released from the Congress meetings, the Report on the Work of the Government, delivered by the premier.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\n495\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024\\n\\n### Chapter 7: Policy and Governance\\n\\nAlbania, Algeria, American Samoa, Andorra, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan The Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Bermuda, Bhutan, Bolivia, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Cayman Islands, Chile, China, Colombia, Croatia, Cuba, Curacao, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Faroe Islands, Fiji, Finland, France, The Gambia, Georgia, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Greenland, Grenada, Guam, Guatemala, Guyana, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Iran Islamic Republic, Iraq, Ireland, Isle of Man, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, Korea Republic, Kosovo, Kyrgyz Republic, Latvia, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macao SAR China, Malawi, Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Nauru, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Northern Marina Islands, Norway, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, St. Kitts and Nevis, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Togo, Tongo, Turkey, Tuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Vietnam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe\\n\\nThe AI Index also gathered information on AI-related regulations enacted in the European Union between 2017 and 2023. To compile this data, the Index team conducted a keyword search for “artificial intelligence” on EUR-Lex, a comprehensive database of EU legislation, regulations, and case law. EUR-Lex provides access to a wide range of regulatory documents, such as legal acts, consolidated texts, international agreements, preparatory documents, and legislative procedures. The analysis in this section focused exclusively on documents with binding regulatory authority. The search for AI-related regulation in the European Union was limited to legal acts, international agreements, and consolidated texts.\\n\\nThe regulation was then coded by a team of two human coders for: (1) relevance to AI, (2) regulatory approach, and (3) subject matter. The relevance to AI categories were low, medium, and high. The regulatory approach categories were expansive or restrictive. For the subject matter categories, the Index employed the Congress policy typology. In cases where there were disagreements on the coding schemas, a third coder was brought in to settle the differences.\\n\\nData on the federal U.S. budget for nondefense AI R&D was taken from previous editions of the AI Index (namely the 2021 and 2022 versions) and from the following National Science and Technology Council reports.\\n\\n### Table of Contents\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\n496\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024\\n\\n### Chapter 7: Policy and Governance\\n\\nSupplement to the President’s FY 2024 Budget\\n\\nSupplement to the President’s FY 2023 Budget\\n\\nSupplement to the President’s FY 2022 Budget\\n\\nGovini\\n\\nGovini is a defense technology company. Ark, Govini’s flagship software, is a suite of AI-enabled applications, powered by integrated government and commercial data, that accelerate the Defense Acquisition Process.\\n\\nWith Ark, the acquisition community eliminates slow, manual processes and gains the ability to rapidly imagine, produce, and field critical warfighting capabilities. Analysts and decision-makers are equipped to solve challenges across the entire spectrum of Defense Acquisition, including Supply Chain, Science and Technology, Production, Sustainment, and Modernization.\\n\\nGovini curated USG AI spend data from their annual Scorecard Taxonomy by applying supervised machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to parse, analyze, and categorize large volumes of federal contracts data, including prime contracts, grants, and other transaction authority (OTA) awards.\\n\\nGovini’s most recent Scorecard focused on Critical Technologies, of which AI/ML Technologies and Microelectronics were segments. The AI/ML segment consisted of five subsegments: Data Integration, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Autonomy, and Natural Language Processing. Microelectronics is divided into two subsegments: Memory and Processing, and Semiconductors.\\n\\nBy initially generating search terms and then subsequently excluding specific terms that yield erroneous results, Govini delivers a comprehensive yet discriminant taxonomy of subsegments that are mutually exclusive. Repeated keyword searches and filters allow a consensus, data-driven taxonomy to come into focus. Govini SMEs conduct final review of taxonomic structure to complement this iterative, data-driven process.\\n\\nThe use of artificial intelligence (AI) and supervised ML models enables analysis of the large volumes of irregular data contained in federal contracts—data that often is inaccessible through regular government reporting processes or human-intensive analytical approaches.\\n\\nMoreover, beyond simply making usable an expansive body of data sources, Govini’s Ark platform and National Security Knowledge Graph establishes high-fidelity standards in categorized and fused data to produce a comprehensive and accurate depiction of federal spending, and the supporting vendor ecosystem, over time.\\n\\n### National AI Strategies\\n\\nThe AI Index did a web search to identify national strategies on AI. Below is a list of countries that were identified as having a national AI strategy, including a link to said strategy. For certain counties, noted with an asterisk (*), the actual strategy was not found, and a news article confirming the launch of the strategy was linked instead.\\n\\n|Country|Link|\\n|---|---|\\n|Country 1|Link 1|\\n|Country 2|Link 2|\\n|Country 3*|News Article Link|\\n\\n### Table of Contents\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\n497\\n---\\n## Countries with AI Strategies in Place\\n\\n|Algeria|Argentina|Azerbaijan|Australia|Austria|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Bahrain|Bangladesh|Benin|Botswana|Brazil|\\n|Belgium|Bulgaria|Canada|Chile|China|\\n|Colombia|Croatia|Cyprus|Czech Republic|Denmark|\\n|Dominican Republic|Egypt, Arab Republic|Ethiopia|Estonia|Finland|\\n|France|Germany|Ghana|Greece|Hong Kong|\\n|Hungary|India|Indonesia|Iran|Iraq|\\n|Ireland|Israel|Italy|Japan|Jordan|\\n|Kenya|Korea Republic|Latvia|Lithuania|Luxembourg|\\n|Malta|Malaysia|Mauritius|Mexico|The Netherlands|\\n|North Korea|Norway|Peru|Philippines|Poland|\\n|Portugal|Qatar|Romania|Russia|Rwanda|\\n|Saudi Arabia|Serbia|Sierra Leone|Singapore|Slovak Republic|\\n|Slovenia|Spain|Sweden|Switzerland|Thailand|\\n|Tunisia|Turkey|Ukraine|United Arab Emirates|United Kingdom|\\n| |United States| |Uruguay|Vietnam|\\n\\n## Countries with AI Strategies in Development\\n\\n|Andorra|Antigua and Barbuda|Barbados|Armenia|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Belarus|Costa Rica|Cuba|Iceland|\\n|Jamaica|Kenya|Morocco|New Zealand|\\n|Nigeria|Pakistan|Senegal|Uzbekistan|\\n\\n## US AI Regulation\\n\\nThis section examines AI-related regulations enacted by American regulatory agencies between 2016 and 2023. It provides an analysis of the total number of regulations, as well as their topics, scope, regulatory intent, and originating agencies. To compile this data, the AI Index team performed a keyword search for “artificial intelligence” on the Federal Register, a comprehensive repository of government documents from nearly all branches of the American government, encompassing more than 436 agencies.\\n\\n## US Department of Defense Budget Requests\\n\\nData on the DoD nonclassified AI-related budget requests was taken from previous editions of the AI Index (namely the 2021 and 2022 versions) and from the following reports:\\n\\n- Defense Budget Overview United States Department of Defense Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Request\\n- Defense Budget Overview United States Department of Defense Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Request\\n- Defense Budget Overview United States Department of Defense Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request\\n\\n## US State-Level AI Legislation\\n\\nFor AI-related bills passed into law, the AI Index performed searches of the keyword “artificial intelligence” on the legislative websites of all 50 U.S. states in the full text of bills. Bills are only counted as passed into law if the final version of the bill includes the keyword, not just the introduced version. Note that only laws passed from 2015 to 2022 are included. The count for proposed laws includes both.\\n---\\n## Appendix\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## Chapter 7: Policy and Governance\\n\\nLaws that were proposed and eventually passed as well as laws that were proposed that have not yet been passed, or are now inactive.

For more complete delineations of the methodology used by the CRA, please consult the individual CRA surveys that are linked below. The CRA Taulbee Survey gathers survey data during the fall of each academic year by reaching out to over 200 PhD-granting departments. Details about the Taulbee Survey can be found here. Taulbee doesn’t directly survey the students. The department identifies each new PhD’s area of specialization as well as their type of employment. Data is collected from September to January of each academic year for PhDs awarded in the previous academic year. Results are published in May after data collection closes. The CRA Taulbee Survey is sent only to doctoral departments of computer science, computer engineering, and information science/systems.

To learn more about the methodology employed for the surveys, please visit the following links: March 2023 and July 2023. Informatics Europe collects statistics annually and publishes them on the Informatics Europe Higher Education Data Portal, which is updated with the most recent data at the end of the year (typically in December). The data is collected from countries where a solid and reasonably complete picture could be drawn from official sources such as national statistical offices, educational agencies, or ministries. The full list of sources can be found in the Data Portal section \"Data Sources.\" The Data Portal follows the definitions and concepts provided by these national agencies and reflects the national situation in the countries considered. Those aspects that are not exposed by the consulted agencies are not part of the dataset. A full list of definitions and concepts used can be found in the footnotes shown at the bottom of the Statistics section. Since each national data repository has its own structure and quite often provides all supporting information in the national language, Informatics Europe consults with its members—academics, active and knowledgeable in the informatics field from respective countries—who help to interpret the statistics available and who understand the specificities of these countries’ higher education systems. One of the main challenges in integrating the statistical data is the identification of terms used to define the informatics discipline in different countries. Informatics is known under different names in different European languages and countries, and in English as well. A good dozen terms (presented in the Data Portal section \"Subjects\") are used to denote what is fundamentally the same discipline, and the role of national experts here is to help with screening the terms and programs and identifying which part of them is pertinent to the informatics field. The data covers the degrees delivered by both traditional Research Universities (RU) and University of Applied Science (UAS) for the countries where these institutions also offer bachelor’s and master’s studies in informatics. The full list of institutions covered can be found in the Data Portal section \"Institutions & Academic Units.\"\\n\\n### Appendix\\n\\n492\\n---\\n## Appendix\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## Chapter 6: Education\\n\\nStudyportals categorizes the study programs on its portals into disciplines and subdisciplines. The 15 disciplines are broad categories of educational fields to help navigate the portals. The 284 subdisciplines are narrower topics, subdivisions, or specialized areas of disciplines. Paying clients can provide input, but ultimately, data processors manually choose the one-to-three closest fitting subdisciplines according to the following scenarios, listed in decreasing order of likelihood. 1. Classic scenario: When the study name closely matches one subdiscipline name. - “Chemistry” -> subdiscipline Chemistry. 2. Classic interdisciplinary scenario: When the study name closely matches two or three subdiscipline names. - “International Fashion Management and Marketing” -> subdisciplines Fashion Management + Marketing. 3. Specializations scenario: When not all the subdisciplines are mentioned in the study name, but they are listed as specific specializations, concentrations, or tracks. - “Business Administration with specializations in Finance and International Business” -> subdisciplines Business Administration + Finance + International Business\\n4. Mixed scenario: When the study name does not closely match any specific subdiscipline but can be represented by combining two or three subdisciplines. - “Financial Economics” -> subdisciplines Finance + Economics\\n5. Last resort scenario: When the study name does not closely match any specific subdiscipline and/or combination, it is instead approximated as closely as possible. - “UK, EU, and US Copyright Law” -> subdisciplines Patent & Intellectual Property Law + International Law + European Law\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\n## Appendix\\n\\n493\\n---\\n|Scenario|Example study name|Example assigned subdisciplines|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Study name closely matches one subdiscipline name.|BSc Chemistry|Chemistry|\\n|Study name closely matches two or three subdiscipline names.|BA International Fashion Management and Marketing|Fashion Management + Marketing|\\n|Not all the subdisciplines are mentioned in the study name, but they are listed as specific specializations, concentrations, or tracks.|MBA Business Administration with specializations in Finance and International Business|Business Administration + Finance + International Business|\\n|Study name does not closely match any specific subdiscipline but can be represented by combining two or three subdisciplines.|MSc Financial Economics|Finance + Economics|\\n|Study name does not closely match any specific subdiscipline and/or combination and is instead approximated as closely as possible.|LLM UK, EU, and US Copyright Law|Patent and Intellectual Property Law + International Law + European Law|\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## Appendix\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## Chapter 7: Policy and Governance\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nThe AI Index would like to acknowledge Simba Jonga for his work collecting information on significant AI policy events and conducting a survey of AI national strategies. Additionally, the Index would like to acknowledge the efforts of Ethan Duncan He-Li Hellman, Julia Betts Lotufo, Alexandra Rome, and Emma Williamson in collecting, coding, and analyzing AI-related legislation and regulations. The Index is also grateful for the guidance provided by Caroline Meinhardt on AI legislation and regulation tracking. Global AI Mentions\\n\\nFor mentions of AI in AI-related legislative proceedings around the world, the AI Index performed searches of the keyword “artificial intelligence” on the websites of 80 countries’ congresses or parliaments (in the respective languages), usually under sections named “minutes,” “hansard,” etc. In some cases, databases were only searchable by title, so site search functions were deployed. The AI Index team surveyed the following databases: Andorra, Angola, Armenia, Australia, Azerbaijan, Barbados, Belgium, Bermuda, Bhutan, Brazil, Cabo Verde, Canada, Cayman Islands, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, France, The Gambia, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Ireland, Isle of Man, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kosovo, Latvia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macao. The National People’s Congress is held once per year and does not provide full legislative proceedings. Hence, the counts included in the analysis only searched mentions of “artificial intelligence” in the only public document released from the Congress meetings, the Report on the Work of the Government, delivered by the premier.

To compile this data, the Index team conducted a keyword search for “artificial intelligence” on EUR-Lex, a comprehensive database of EU legislation, regulations, and case law. EUR-Lex provides access to a wide range of regulatory documents, such as legal acts, consolidated texts, international agreements, preparatory documents, and legislative procedures. The analysis in this section focused exclusively on documents with binding regulatory authority. The search for AI-related regulation in the European Union was limited to legal acts, international agreements, and consolidated texts. The regulation was then coded by a team of two human coders for: (1) relevance to AI, (2) regulatory approach, and (3) subject matter. The relevance to AI categories were low, medium, and high. The regulatory approach categories were expansive or restrictive. For the subject matter categories, the Index employed the Congress policy typology. In cases where there were disagreements on the coding schemas, a third coder was brought in to settle the differences. Data on the federal U.S. budget for nondefense AI R&D was taken from previous editions of the AI Index (namely the 2021 and 2022 versions) and from the following National Science and Technology Council reports. ### Table of Contents\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\n496\\n---\\n## Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024\\n\\n### Chapter 7: Policy and Governance\\n\\nSupplement to the President’s FY 2024 Budget\\n\\nSupplement to the President’s FY 2023 Budget\\n\\nSupplement to the President’s FY 2022 Budget\\n\\nGovini\\n\\nGovini is a defense technology company. Ark, Govini’s flagship software, is a suite of AI-enabled applications, powered by integrated government and commercial data, that accelerate the Defense Acquisition Process. With Ark, the acquisition community eliminates slow, manual processes and gains the ability to rapidly imagine, produce, and field critical warfighting capabilities. Analysts and decision-makers are equipped to solve challenges across the entire spectrum of Defense Acquisition, including Supply Chain, Science and Technology, Production, Sustainment, and Modernization. Govini curated USG AI spend data from their annual Scorecard Taxonomy by applying supervised machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to parse, analyze, and categorize large volumes of federal contracts data, including prime contracts, grants, and other transaction authority (OTA) awards. Govini’s most recent Scorecard focused on Critical Technologies, of which AI/ML Technologies and Microelectronics were segments. The AI/ML segment consisted of five subsegments: Data Integration, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Autonomy, and Natural Language Processing. Microelectronics is divided into two subsegments: Memory and Processing, and Semiconductors. By initially generating search terms and then subsequently excluding specific terms that yield erroneous results, Govini delivers a comprehensive yet discriminant taxonomy of subsegments that are mutually exclusive. Repeated keyword searches and filters allow a consensus, data-driven taxonomy to come into focus. Govini SMEs conduct final review of taxonomic structure to complement this iterative, data-driven process. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and supervised ML models enables analysis of the large volumes of irregular data contained in federal contracts—data that often is inaccessible through regular government reporting processes or human-intensive analytical approaches. Moreover, beyond simply making usable an expansive body of data sources, Govini’s Ark platform and National Security Knowledge Graph establishes high-fidelity standards in categorized and fused data to produce a comprehensive and accurate depiction of federal spending, and the supporting vendor ecosystem, over time. ### National AI Strategies\\n\\nThe AI Index did a web search to identify national strategies on AI. Below is a list of countries that were identified as having a national AI strategy, including a link to said strategy. For certain counties, noted with an asterisk (*), the actual strategy was not found, and a news article confirming the launch of the strategy was linked instead. |Country|Link|\\n|---|---|\\n|Country 1|Link 1|\\n|Country 2|Link 2|\\n|Country 3*|News Article Link|\\n\\n### Table of Contents\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\n497\\n---\\n## Countries with AI Strategies in Place\\n\\n|Algeria|Argentina|Azerbaijan|Australia|Austria|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Bahrain|Bangladesh|Benin|Botswana|Brazil|\\n|Belgium|Bulgaria|Canada|Chile|China|\\n|Colombia|Croatia|Cyprus|Czech Republic|Denmark|\\n|Dominican Republic|Egypt, Arab Republic|Ethiopia|Estonia|Finland|\\n|France|Germany|Ghana|Greece|Hong Kong|\\n|Hungary|India|Indonesia|Iran|Iraq|\\n|Ireland|Israel|Italy|Japan|Jordan|\\n|Kenya|Korea Republic|Latvia|Lithuania|Luxembourg|\\n|Malta|Malaysia|Mauritius|Mexico|The Netherlands|\\n|North Korea|Norway|Peru|Philippines|Poland|\\n|Portugal|Qatar|Romania|Russia|Rwanda|\\n|Saudi Arabia|Serbia|Sierra Leone|Singapore|Slovak Republic|\\n|Slovenia|Spain|Sweden|Switzerland|Thailand|\\n|Tunisia|Turkey|Ukraine|United Arab Emirates|United Kingdom|\\n| |United States| |Uruguay|Vietnam|\\n\\n## Countries with AI Strategies in Development\\n\\n|Andorra|Antigua and Barbuda|Barbados|Armenia|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Belarus|Costa Rica|Cuba|Iceland|\\n|Jamaica|Kenya|Morocco|New Zealand|\\n|Nigeria|Pakistan|Senegal|Uzbekistan|\\n\\n## US AI Regulation\\n\\nThis section examines AI-related regulations enacted by American regulatory agencies between 2016 and 2023. It provides an analysis of the total number of regulations, as well as their topics, scope, regulatory intent, and originating agencies. To compile this data, the AI Index team performed a keyword search for “artificial intelligence” on the Federal Register, a comprehensive repository of government documents from nearly all branches of the American government, encompassing more than 436 agencies. ## US Department of Defense Budget Requests\\n\\nData on the DoD nonclassified AI-related budget requests was taken from previous editions of the AI Index (namely the 2021 and 2022 versions) and from the following reports:\\n\\n- Defense Budget Overview United States Department of Defense Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Request\\n- Defense Budget Overview United States Department of Defense Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Request\\n- Defense Budget Overview United States Department of Defense Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request\\n\\n## US State-Level AI Legislation\\n\\nFor AI-related bills passed into law, the AI Index performed searches of the keyword “artificial intelligence” on the legislative websites of all 50 U.S. states in the full text of bills. Bills are only counted as passed into law if the final version of the bill includes the keyword, not just the introduced version. Note that only laws passed from 2015 to 2022 are included. The count for proposed laws includes both. ---\\n## Appendix\\n\\n## Index Report 2024\\n\\n## Chapter 7: Policy and Governance\\n\\nLaws that were proposed and eventually passed as well as laws that were proposed that have not yet been passed, or are now inactive.
